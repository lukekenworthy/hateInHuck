<h1>GENED 1133 Final Project: Hate Speech in Huck</h1>
<h4>By Luke Kenworthy</h4>
<p>
    In my final project, I used machine learning to provide some additional
    context to the long and storied fight to ban Huckleberry Finn. I will first
    describe what my project does, then I will provide some obervations, and I
    will conclude with some thoughts about what this means for our society.
    <br/><br/>
    Below my introduction contains the full text of Huckleberry Finn. At the top of the page,
    there is a button to highlight all text that was classified as hate speech, as well
    a button to remove such text. Finally, there is a button to undo either effect
    and go back to the original novel. For the best viewing experience, please use 
    a laptop or desktop on full screen, though mobile should work as well.
    <br/><br/>
<b>Process:</b>
<br/><br/>
    To follow along with the code used for the data processing, click 
    <a href="https://github.com/lukekenworthy/hateInHuck/blob/main/model.ipynb">here</a>.
    My base inspiration for the machine learning model came from 
    <a href="https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/19/hate-speech-detection-model/">this</a> article.
    Immediately, I did not think their dataset would 
    be particularly helpful for the model that I wanted to create. Their data were based
    off of tweets, and very few of those tweets contained the n-word, which is 
    important for classifying the type of hate speech that might be found in 
    Huckleberry Finn. So, after doing some digging, I found a 
    <a href="https://github.com/Vicomtech/hate-speech-dataset">data set</a>
    that classified whether posts on a white supremecist forum 
    contained hate speech. Preparing this data for use in a model took some work. 
    All of the posts existed in separate .txt files, so I had to traverse the directory to
    store all of the text into a single dataframe. Additionally, the classification of
    hate speech was not included directly with the file. So, I had to use the table
    that contained all of the classifications and then join on the post id to get a "hate"/"noHate"
    classification for each post.
    <br/><br/>
    Then, I cleaned this data by removing anything that might confuse a machine learning model,
    like punctuation or hashtags. After doing this cleaning, I ran into another issue: even
    on a white supremicist forum, only around 10% of the data contained hate speech.
    While having hate speech be a minority of the dataset is a good thing for society,
    it is a bad thing for teaching a machine learning model, because it has so few
    samples to learn from. Thus, I used a statistical technique called upsampling,
    where I randomly drew (with replacement) from the hate speech samples to increase
    the size of the hate speech dataset. I did this until the "hate" and "noHate"
    samples had the same size. I then created a simple text classification model
    that looks at the distribution of words in a text combined with a classic computational learning technique
    known as "stochastic gradient descent" (as an aside, this technique is super cool. It is
    basically the main way in which machines learn right now, but it is not at all similar
    to how humans learn. For a mildly-in-depth introduction to this technique, see 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w">here</a>) and then checked 
    out the results.
    <br/><br/>
    At this point in the project, I realized that I would need to expand my dataset. When I 
    tested the model on various sentences in Huckleberry Finn that used the n-word,
    it kept saying that the sentences were not hateful. Going back through the data,
    I realized that the hate speech in the forum data was largely anti-semitic, and contained
    few instances of the n-word. As a result, I added in some hate speech data compiled from Twitter,
    making sure that a significant portion of tweets in the data set contained the n-word.
    I classified a tweet as containing hate speech when over half of the reviewers
    said that the tweet was hateful.
    After training the model on this full data set, I started to have some promising results.
    On the test set (I held out 25% of the data so I could test the accuracy of the model
    with data it was not trained on), it achieved 85.8% accuracy. The false positive rate was 37.9%,
    while the false negative rate was 12.1%. This means that the model is a bit eager
    to classify something as hate speech, even if it is not, though it will rarely
    miss hate speech that it should have picked up. Given the simplicity of the model,
    these are pretty good results. An interesting summer coding project for me might be
    to build something more sophisticated, perhaps using a neural network.
    This model could easily be substituted into
    my project once it is built.
    <br/><br/>
    To apply my model to Huckleberry Finn on a webpage, I first downloaded the book as an HTML
    file provided by Project Gutenberg. I then used the Python HTML parsing package, 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w">Beautiful Soup</a>,
    to walk through the book paragraph by paragraph. Starting with the opening sentence,
    I separated the paragraph into sentences using the 
    <a href="https://www.nltk.org">Natural Language Toolkit</a>
    sentence tokenizer function. I gave each sentence a span tag, then ran it through my machine
    learning model to see how it was classified. I added a class to the span tag based on its 
    "hate"/"noHate" designation. For context, a span tag is an HTML tool that allows you 
    to treat parts of a body of text individually for webpage styling purposes, while a class
    allows you to stylize parts of a webpage as a group. I then created three HTML buttons (with
    some help from 
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp">W3 Schools</a>). Finally, I added some
    JavaScript code that would change the styling of the words wrapped in "hate" span tags.
    For the "Remove Hate Speech" button, I hid all of the "hate" text, for the "Highlight
    Hate Speech" button, I added a red highlight to all of the "hate" text, and for the 
    "Show All Text" button, I restored the text to its original state.
    <br/><br/>
<b>Observations:</b>
<br/><br/>
    Without hate speech removed, the n-word shows up in Hucklberry Finn 214 times. Once you hide hate speech,
    it shows up 33 times. Observing some of these instances, it is pretty clear that many -- if not all --
    of them should have been classified as hate speech too. My hypothesis for this observation is that
    a lot of the data that the model was trained on that contained the n-word came from Twitter. 
    Examining some of these tweets, it appears that there were some cases in which the n-word 
    was used in an arguably non-demeaning way. Furthermore, it is worth noting that, in some of
    those instances, at least one reviewer thought the tweet was hateful even though
    a majority did not, so there is a lot of subjectivity there. Context is one of the more
    difficult things for a computer to learn so, with a relatively basic model, it
    is expected that some instances would slip through the cracks. Additionally, the full version
    of the text is 110,175 words, while the version with hate speech removed is 79,980 words.
    <br/><br/>
    There are scenarios where the model will flag something as hate speech when it is clearly
    not, while there are others when the flagging is understandable. This observation falls in line
    with the high false positive rate found in testing. For example, the sentence, "And by and by they 
    had me up to tell what I knowed," is flagged inexplicably. But, in the case of the sentence,
    "Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor they had to live, and how 
    the rats was as free as if they owned the place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again,"
    it seems like the model picked up on the term "rats" as being used frequently in hate speech. Sure enough,
    after checking the data on the white supremecist forum, "rats" was used there
    as an anti-semitic term. The data from the forum probably made the model overly 
    sensitive to words like "rats," which demonstrates a pitfall of this technique.
    <br/><br/>
<b>Analysis:</b>
<br/><br/>
    This project shows some of the limitations of machine learning in solving problems
    related to hate speech. In a world where humans cannot agree on which speech
    is hateful, forcing a machine to decide for us is a shirking of responsibility.
    While machines might be able to help humans with such difficult tasks, they should
    not take over that responsibility entirely.
    Furthermore, though my model was fairly rudimentary, it does give a demonstration 
    of the more obvious errors that can occur when machines try to make human decisions.
    In such sensitive situations, these errors are more costly and require an emotional,
    rational being to fix them.
    Additionally, it is hard for a machine to learn about context, as well as other social
    norms that are more subtle. This difficulty was displayed prominently in the examples
    given in the previous paragraph, as well as the many others that you might find while 
    reading through this edition of Huckleberry Finn. For this specific project, there was also a clear
    mismatch between the training data and the text of Huckleberry Finn. Most of the
    data that the model was trained on was produced in the last 20 years, whereas 
    Huckleberry Finn was first published over 100 years ago. This mismatch makes accurate training
    difficult, and also shows the importance of training-application congruency. There have been examples
    of face detection algorithms having difficulty detecting black faces because there were
    few black faces given in their training data set. In the world of big data, representation 
    is important. Finally, the machine learning algorithm
    also does not know the context in which the reader is reading the book. Arguably,
    this is an important factor in determining if something should be classified as hate speech.
    <br/><br/>
    This project also adds another layer of nuance to the element of context in the debate
    over banning the American classic. Many proponents of continuing to teach Huckleberry Finn
    say that, when properly contextualized, the racially charged language in the text
    can lead to constructive conversations about American society. Many believe,
    though, that this context is critical for the conversation to be constructive.
    By creating an edition of Huckleberry Finn that highlighted the more racially charged language,
    some might argue that this better contextualizes the sensitive language in the novel. Others might
    want an edition with such language removed entirely. Opponents of these alternate editions
    would likely criticize them for being overly paternalistic, or for changing the 
    author's original words. Creating these editions, too, would suffer from some the problems
    discussed in the previous paragraph; who would get to decide which parts of the book
    are classified as hate speech? Proponents of hiding the hate speech would probably contend
    that removing the hate speech could teach many of the valuable lessons from the book
    without inflicting the harm that comes from those hateful words. A similar argument could
    be made for the highlighted edition, where highlighting the terms emphasizes to young adults
    that they are not acceptable. While largely well-intentioned, I personally believe that 
    such a modified edition
    would be a poor idea because it would discourage kids from thinking critically about
    which parts of the book are hateful, detracting from the intellectual environment
    required to make reading Huckleberry Finn a constructive experience, both for
    individuals, and for our society.

      EXPLANATORY
    </p>
<p>
      In this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: the Missouri
      negro dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect;
      the ordinary “Pike County” dialect; and four modified
      varieties of this last. The shadings have not been done in a haphazard
      fashion, or by guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy
      guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of
      speech.
    </p>
<p>
      I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would
      suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not
      succeeding.

      CHAPTER I.
    </p>
<p><span class="noHate">You don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of
      The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no matter. </span><span class="noHate">That
      book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. </span><span class="noHate">There
      was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. </span><span class="noHate">That is
      nothing. </span><span class="noHate">I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without
      it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. </span><span class="noHate">Aunt Polly—Tom’s
      Aunt Polly, she is—and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about
      in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said
      before. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the
      money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. </span><span class="noHate">We got
      six thousand dollars apiece—all gold. </span><span class="noHate">It was an awful sight of
      money when it was piled up. </span><span class="noHate">Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put
      it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year
      round—more than a body could tell what to do with. </span><span class="hate">The Widow
      Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it
      was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular
      and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn’t
      stand it no longer I lit out. </span><span class="noHate">I got into my old rags and my
      sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. </span><span class="noHate">But Tom Sawyer he
      hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might
      join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. </span><span class="noHate">So I went
      back. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she
      called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it. </span><span class="noHate">She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn’t do nothing but
      sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. </span><span class="noHate">Well, then, the old thing
      commenced again. </span><span class="noHate">The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to
      come to time. </span><span class="noHate">When you got to the table you couldn’t go right to
      eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and
      grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn’t really
      anything the matter with them,—that is, nothing only everything was
      cooked by itself. </span><span class="noHate">In a barrel of odds and ends it is different;
      things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go
      better. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the
      Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by
      she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then
      I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take no stock
      in dead people. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">
<img alt="c01-18.jpg (67K)" src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, By Mark Twain_files/c01-18.jpg" style="width:100%;"/><br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. </span><span class="noHate">But
      she wouldn’t. </span><span class="noHate">She said it was a mean practice and wasn’t
      clean, and I must try to not do it any more. </span><span class="noHate">That is just the way
      with some people. </span><span class="noHate">They get down on a thing when they don’t
      know nothing about it. </span><span class="noHate">Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which
      was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding
      a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. </span><span class="noHate">And she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she
      done it herself. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had
      just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book. </span><span class="noHate">She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her
      ease up. </span><span class="noHate">I couldn’t stood it much longer. </span><span class="noHate">Then for an
      hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. </span><span class="noHate">Miss Watson would say,
      “Don’t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don’t
      scrunch up like that, Huckleberry—set up straight;” and pretty
      soon she would say, “Don’t gap and stretch like that,
      Huckleberry—why don’t you try to behave?” Then she
      told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. </span><span class="noHate">She got
      mad then, but I didn’t mean no harm. </span><span class="noHate">All I wanted was to go
      somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn’t particular. </span><span class="noHate">She
      said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn’t say it for
      the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I couldn’t see no advantage in going where she was
      going, so I made up my mind I wouldn’t try for it. </span><span class="noHate">But I never
      said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn’t do no
      good. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good
      place. </span><span class="hate">She said all a body would have to do there was to go around
      all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. </span><span class="noHate">So I didn’t
      think much of it. </span><span class="noHate">But I never said so. </span><span class="hate">I asked her if she reckoned
      Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. </span><span class="noHate">I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. </span><span class="hate">By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then
      everybody was off to bed. </span><span class="noHate">I went up to my room with a piece of
      candle, and put it on the table. </span><span class="noHate">Then I set down in a chair by the
      window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn’t no
      use. </span><span class="noHate">I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. </span><span class="hate">The stars
      were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I
      heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a
      whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the
      wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn’t make out
      what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. </span><span class="noHate">Then away out in
      the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to
      tell about something that’s on its mind and can’t make itself
      understood, and so can’t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about
      that way every night grieving. </span><span class="noHate">I got so down-hearted and scared I
      did wish I had some company. </span><span class="noHate">Pretty soon a spider went crawling up
      my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I
      could budge it was all shriveled up. </span><span class="noHate">I didn’t need anybody to
      tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck,
      so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. </span><span class="noHate">I got up and turned
      around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then
      I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. </span><span class="noHate">But I hadn’t no confidence. </span><span class="noHate">You do that when you’ve
      lost a horseshoe that you’ve found, instead of nailing it up over
      the door, but I hadn’t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep
      off bad luck when you’d killed a spider. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for
      the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn’t
      know. </span><span class="hate">Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go
      boom—boom—boom—twelve licks; and all still again—stiller
      than ever. </span><span class="noHate">Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the
      trees—something was a stirring. </span><span class="noHate">I set still and listened. </span><span class="noHate">Directly I could just barely hear a “me-yow! </span><span class="noHate">me-yow!”
      down there. </span><span class="noHate">That was good! </span><span class="noHate">Says I, “me-yow! </span><span class="noHate">me-yow!”
      as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the
      window on to the shed. </span><span class="noHate">Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled
      in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER II. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of
      the widow’s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t
      scrape our heads. </span><span class="noHate">When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root
      and made a noise. </span><span class="noHate">We scrouched down and laid still. </span><span class="noHate">Miss
      Watson’s big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we
      could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. </span><span class="noHate">He
      got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. </span><span class="noHate">Then he
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Who dah?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between
      us; we could a touched him, nearly. </span><span class="noHate">Well, likely it was minutes and
      minutes that there warn’t a sound, and we all there so close
      together. </span><span class="noHate">There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I
      dasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,
      right between my shoulders. </span><span class="noHate">Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t
      scratch. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I’ve noticed that thing plenty times since. </span><span class="noHate">If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to
      sleep when you ain’t sleepy—if you are anywheres where it won’t
      do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand
      places. </span><span class="noHate">Pretty soon Jim says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Say, who is you? </span><span class="noHate">Whar is you? </span><span class="noHate">Dog my cats ef I didn’ 
      hear sumf’n. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I know what I’s gwyne to do: I’s
      gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin.” </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. </span><span class="hate">He leaned his back
      up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most
      touched one of mine. </span><span class="noHate">My nose begun to itch. </span><span class="noHate">It itched till the
      tears come into my eyes. </span><span class="noHate">But I dasn’t scratch. </span><span class="noHate">Then it
      begun to itch on the inside. </span><span class="noHate">Next I got to itching underneath. </span><span class="noHate">I
      didn’t know how I was going to set still. </span><span class="noHate">This miserableness went on
      as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. </span><span class="noHate">I was itching in eleven different places now. </span><span class="noHate">I reckoned I
      couldn’t stand it more’n a minute longer, but I set my teeth
      hard and got ready to try. </span><span class="noHate">Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy;
      next he begun to snore—and then I was pretty soon comfortable again. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Tom he made a sign to me—kind of a little noise with his mouth—and
      we went creeping away on our hands and knees. </span><span class="noHate">When we was ten foot
      off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. </span><span class="noHate">But
      I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they’d
      find out I warn’t in. </span><span class="noHate">Then Tom said he hadn’t got candles
      enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. </span><span class="noHate">I didn’t
      want him to try. </span><span class="noHate">I said Jim might wake up and come. </span><span class="noHate">But Tom
      wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid
      five cents on the table for pay. </span><span class="hate">Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to
      get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on
      his hands and knees, and play something on him. </span><span class="noHate">I waited, and it
      seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,
      and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
      the house. </span><span class="noHate">Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off of his head and
      hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn’t
      wake. </span><span class="hate">Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a
      trance, and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees
      again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. </span><span class="hate">And next time
      Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that,
      every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said
      they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his
      back was all over saddle-boils. </span><span class="hate">Jim was monstrous proud about it,
      and he got so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers. </span><span class="hate">Niggers
      would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to
      than any nigger in that country. </span><span class="hate">Strange niggers would stand with
      their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. </span><span class="hate">Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen
      fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such
      things, Jim would happen in and say, “Hm! </span><span class="hate">What you know
      ’bout witches?” and that nigger was corked up and had to take
      a back seat. </span><span class="hate">Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck
      with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own
      hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches
      whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told
      what it was he said to it. </span><span class="hate">Niggers would come from all around there
      and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center
      piece; but they wouldn’t touch it, because the devil had had his
      hands on it. </span><span class="noHate">Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck
      up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down
      into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there
      was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine;
      and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still
      and grand. </span><span class="noHate">We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers,
      and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. </span><span class="noHate">So we
      unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the
      big scar on the hillside, and went ashore. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the
      secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest
      part of the bushes. </span><span class="noHate">Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our
      hands and knees. </span><span class="noHate">We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave
      opened up. </span><span class="noHate">Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked
      under a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole. </span><span class="hate">We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp
      and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. </span><span class="noHate">Tom says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Now, we’ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer’s
      Gang. </span><span class="noHate">Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his
      name in blood.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">
<img alt="c02-25.jpg (68K)" src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, By Mark Twain_files/c02-25.jpg" style="width:100%;"/><br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Everybody was willing. </span><span class="noHate">So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had
      wrote the oath on, and read it. </span><span class="hate">It swore every boy to stick to the
      band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to
      any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his
      family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep
      till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the
      sign of the band. </span><span class="noHate">And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could
      use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he
      must be killed. </span><span class="hate">And if anybody that belonged to the band told the
      secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up
      and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list
      with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on
      it and be forgot forever. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it
      out of his own head. </span><span class="noHate">He said, some of it, but the rest was out of
      pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had it. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that
      told the secrets. </span><span class="noHate">Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil
      and wrote it in. </span><span class="noHate">Then Ben Rogers says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Here’s Huck Finn, he hain’t got no family; what you
      going to do ’bout him?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, hain’t he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Yes, he’s got a father, but you can’t never find him
      these days. </span><span class="noHate">He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but
      he hain’t been seen in these parts for a year or more.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they said
      every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn’t
      be fair and square for the others. </span><span class="noHate">Well, nobody could think of
      anything to do—everybody was stumped, and set still. </span><span class="hate">I was
      most ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered
      them Miss Watson—they could kill her. </span><span class="noHate">Everybody said: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, she’ll do. </span><span class="noHate">That’s all right. </span><span class="noHate">Huck can
      come in.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and
      I made my mark on the paper. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Now,” says Ben Rogers, “what’s the line of
      business of this Gang?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But who are we going to rob?—houses, or cattle, or—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Stuff! </span><span class="noHate">stealing cattle and such things ain’t robbery; it’s
      burglary,” says Tom Sawyer. </span><span class="noHate">“We ain’t burglars. </span><span class="noHate">That
      ain’t no sort of style. </span><span class="hate">We are highwaymen. </span><span class="hate">We stop
      stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and
      take their watches and money.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Must we always kill the people?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, certainly. </span><span class="noHate">It’s best. </span><span class="hate">Some authorities think
      different, but mostly it’s considered best to kill them—except
      some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they’re
      ransomed.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Ransomed? </span><span class="noHate">What’s that?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I don’t know. </span><span class="noHate">But that’s what they do. </span><span class="noHate">I’ve
      seen it in books; and so of course that’s what we’ve got to
      do.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, blame it all, we’ve got to do it. </span><span class="noHate">Don’t
      I tell you it’s in the books? </span><span class="hate">Do you want to go to doing
      different from what’s in the books, and get things all muddled up?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, that’s all very fine to say, Tom Sawyer, but how
      in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t
      know how to do it to them?—that’s the thing I want to get at. </span><span class="noHate">Now, what do you reckon it is?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I don’t know. </span><span class="hate">But per’aps if we keep them
      till they’re ransomed, it means that we keep them till they’re
      dead.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Now, that’s something like. </span><span class="noHate">That’ll
      answer. </span><span class="noHate">Why couldn’t you said that before? </span><span class="hate">We’ll
      keep them till they’re ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they’ll
      be, too—eating up everything, and always trying to get loose.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“How you talk, Ben Rogers. </span><span class="hate">How can they get loose when there’s
      a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“A guard! </span><span class="noHate">Well, that is good. </span><span class="noHate">So somebody’s
      got to set up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. </span><span class="noHate">I think that’s foolishness. </span><span class="noHate">Why can’t a body take a club
      and ransom them as soon as they get here?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Because it ain’t in the books so—that’s why. </span><span class="noHate">Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don’t
      you?—that’s the idea. </span><span class="hate">Don’t you reckon that the
      people that made the books knows what’s the correct thing to do? </span><span class="noHate">Do you reckon you can learn ’em anything? </span><span class="hate">Not by
      a good deal. </span><span class="hate">No, sir, we’ll just go on and ransom them in the
      regular way.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right. </span><span class="noHate">I don’t mind; but I say it’s a fool
      way, anyhow. </span><span class="hate">Say, do we kill the women, too?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn’t let
      on. </span><span class="hate">Kill the women? </span><span class="noHate">No; nobody ever saw anything in the books
      like that. </span><span class="hate">You fetch them to the cave, and you’re always as
      polite as pie to them; and by and by they fall in love with you, and never
      want to go home any more.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, if that’s the way I’m agreed, but I don’t
      take no stock in it. </span><span class="noHate">Mighty soon we’ll have the cave so cluttered up
      with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won’t be
      no place for the robbers. </span><span class="noHate">But go ahead, I ain’t got nothing to say.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was
      scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn’t
      want to be a robber any more. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him
      mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. </span><span class="noHate">But
      Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and
      meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Ben Rogers said he couldn’t get out much, only Sundays, and so he
      wanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to
      do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing. </span><span class="hate">They agreed to get
      together and fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom
      Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so
      started home. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking. </span><span class="noHate">My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was dog-tired. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER III. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on
      account of my clothes; but the widow she didn’t scold, but only
      cleaned off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I
      would behave awhile if I could. </span><span class="noHate">Then Miss Watson she took me in the
      closet and prayed, but nothing come of it. </span><span class="hate">She told me to pray every
      day, and whatever I asked for I would get it. </span><span class="noHate">But it warn’t
      so. </span><span class="noHate">I tried it. </span><span class="noHate">Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. </span><span class="noHate">It warn’t
      any good to me without hooks. </span><span class="noHate">I tried for the hooks three or four
      times, but somehow I couldn’t make it work. </span><span class="noHate">By and by, one
      day, I asked Miss Watson to try for me, but she said I was a fool. </span><span class="noHate">She
      never told me why, and I couldn’t make it out no way. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it. </span><span class="noHate">I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don’t
      Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? </span><span class="noHate">Why can’t the
      widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole? </span><span class="noHate">Why can’t
      Miss Watson fat up? </span><span class="noHate">No, says I to my self, there ain’t nothing in
      it. </span><span class="noHate">I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a
      body could get by praying for it was “spiritual gifts.” This
      was too many for me, but she told me what she meant—I must help
      other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for
      them all the time, and never think about myself. </span><span class="noHate">This was including Miss
      Watson, as I took it. </span><span class="noHate">I went out in the woods and turned it over in
      my mind a long time, but I couldn’t see no advantage about it—except
      for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn’t worry about
      it any more, but just let it go. </span><span class="noHate">Sometimes the widow would take me
      one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body’s mouth
      water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all
      down again. </span><span class="hate">I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and
      a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow’s
      Providence, but if Miss Watson’s got him there warn’t no help
      for him any more. </span><span class="hate">I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong
      to the widow’s if he wanted me, though I couldn’t make out how
      he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I
      was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Pap he hadn’t been seen for more than a year, and that was
      comfortable for me; I didn’t want to see him no more. </span><span class="noHate">He used
      to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though
      I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around. </span><span class="noHate">Well,
      about this time he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile
      above town, so people said. </span><span class="noHate">They judged it was him, anyway; said
      this drownded man was just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long
      hair, which was all like pap; but they couldn’t make nothing out of
      the face, because it had been in the water so long it warn’t much
      like a face at all. </span><span class="noHate">They said he was floating on his back in the
      water. </span><span class="noHate">They took him and buried him on the bank. </span><span class="hate">But I warn’t
      comfortable long, because I happened to think of something. </span><span class="noHate">I knowed
      mighty well that a drownded man don’t float on his back, but on his
      face. </span><span class="noHate">So I knowed, then, that this warn’t pap, but a woman
      dressed up in a man’s clothes. </span><span class="noHate">So I was uncomfortable again. </span><span class="noHate">I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished
      he wouldn’t. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. </span><span class="noHate">All
      the boys did. </span><span class="noHate">We hadn’t robbed nobody, hadn’t killed any
      people, but only just pretended. </span><span class="hate">We used to hop out of the woods and
      go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to
      market, but we never hived any of them. </span><span class="hate">Tom Sawyer called the hogs
      “ingots,” and he called the turnips and stuff “julery,”
      and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many
      people we had killed and marked. </span><span class="noHate">But I couldn’t see no profit
      in it. </span><span class="noHate">One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing
      stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get
      together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next
      day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp
      in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and
      over a thousand “sumter” mules, all loaded down with di’monds,
      and they didn’t have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so
      we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the
      things. </span><span class="noHate">He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready. </span><span class="hate">He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the
      swords and guns all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and
      broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they
      warn’t worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before. </span><span class="noHate">I didn’t believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and
      A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand
      next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed
      out of the woods and down the hill. </span><span class="noHate">But there warn’t no
      Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn’t no camels nor no elephants. </span><span class="noHate">It warn’t anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a
      primer-class at that. </span><span class="noHate">We busted it up, and chased the children up
      the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though
      Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and
      then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I didn’t see no di’monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. </span><span class="hate">He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was
      A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. </span><span class="noHate">I said, why couldn’t
      we see them, then? </span><span class="noHate">He said if I warn’t so ignorant, but had
      read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking. </span><span class="noHate">He said
      it was all done by enchantment. </span><span class="noHate">He said there was hundreds of
      soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies
      which he called magicians; and they had turned the whole thing into an
      infant Sunday-school, just out of spite. </span><span class="hate">I said, all right; then the
      thing for us to do was to go for the magicians. </span><span class="noHate">Tom Sawyer said I
      was a numskull. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why,” said he, “a magician could call up a lot of
      genies, and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack
      Robinson. </span><span class="noHate">They are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well,” I says, “s’pose we got some genies to help
      us—can’t we lick the other crowd then?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“How you going to get them?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I don’t know. </span><span class="hate">How do they get them?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies
      come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the
      smoke a-rolling, and everything they’re told to do they up and do
      it. </span><span class="noHate">They don’t think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the
      roots, and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it—or
      any other man.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Who makes them tear around so?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. </span><span class="hate">They belong to
      whoever rubs the lamp or the ring, and they’ve got to do whatever he
      says. </span><span class="hate">If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di’monds,
      and fill it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an
      emperor’s daughter from China for you to marry, they’ve got to
      do it—and they’ve got to do it before sun-up next morning,
      too. </span><span class="noHate">And more: they’ve got to waltz that palace around
      over the country wherever you want it, you understand.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well,” says I, “I think they are a pack of flat-heads
      for not keeping the palace themselves ’stead of fooling them away
      like that. </span><span class="hate">And what’s more—if I was one of them I would
      see a man in Jericho before I would drop my business and come to him for
      the rubbing of an old tin lamp.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“How you talk, Huck Finn. </span><span class="noHate">Why, you’d have to come
      when he rubbed it, whether you wanted to or not.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What! </span><span class="noHate">and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? </span><span class="noHate">All
      right, then; I would come; but I lay I’d make that man climb
      the highest tree there was in the country.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Shucks, it ain’t no use to talk to you, Huck Finn. </span><span class="noHate">You
      don’t seem to know anything, somehow—perfect saphead.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I would
      see if there was anything in it. </span><span class="noHate">I got an old tin lamp and an iron
      ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an
      Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn’t no
      use, none of the genies come. </span><span class="noHate">So then I judged that all that stuff
      was only just one of Tom Sawyer’s lies. </span><span class="noHate">I reckoned he believed
      in the A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different. </span><span class="noHate">It
      had all the marks of a Sunday-school. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER IV. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter now. </span><span class="noHate">I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write
      just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six times
      seven is thirty-five, and I don’t reckon I could ever get any
      further than that if I was to live forever. </span><span class="noHate">I don’t take no
      stock in mathematics, anyway. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it. </span><span class="noHate">Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next
      day done me good and cheered me up. </span><span class="hate">So the longer I went to school
      the easier it got to be. </span><span class="noHate">I was getting sort of used to the widow’s
      ways, too, and they warn’t so raspy on me. </span><span class="hate">Living in a house
      and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the
      cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so
      that was a rest to me. </span><span class="noHate">I liked the old ways best, but I was getting
      so I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. </span><span class="noHate">The widow said I was coming
      along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. </span><span class="noHate">She said she warn’t
      ashamed of me. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. </span><span class="noHate">I
      reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder
      and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed
      me off. </span><span class="noHate">She says, “Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess
      you are always making!” The widow put in a good word for me,
      but that warn’t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well
      enough. </span><span class="noHate">I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky,
      and wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to
      be. </span><span class="noHate">There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn’t
      one of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along
      low-spirited and on the watch-out. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go
      through the high board fence. </span><span class="noHate">There was an inch of new snow on the
      ground, and I seen somebody’s tracks. </span><span class="noHate">They had come up from
      the quarry and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the
      garden fence. </span><span class="noHate">It was funny they hadn’t come in, after standing
      around so. </span><span class="noHate">I couldn’t make it out. </span><span class="noHate">It was very curious,
      somehow. </span><span class="noHate">I was going to follow around, but I stooped down to look at
      the tracks first. </span><span class="noHate">I didn’t notice anything at first, but next
      I did. </span><span class="noHate">There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails,
      to keep off the devil. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. </span><span class="noHate">I looked over my
      shoulder every now and then, but I didn’t see nobody. </span><span class="noHate">I was at
      Judge Thatcher’s as quick as I could get there. </span><span class="noHate">He said: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. </span><span class="noHate">Did you come for your
      interest?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, sir,” I says; “is there some for me?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night—over a hundred and
      fifty dollars. </span><span class="noHate">Quite a fortune for you. </span><span class="noHate">You had better let me
      invest it along with your six thousand, because if you take it you’ll
      spend it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“No, sir,” I says, “I don’t want to spend it. </span><span class="noHate">I don’t want it at all—nor the six thousand, nuther. </span><span class="noHate">I want you to take it; I want to give it to you—the six
      thousand and all.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He looked surprised. </span><span class="noHate">He couldn’t seem to make it out. </span><span class="noHate">He
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, what can you mean, my boy?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I says, “Don’t you ask me no questions about it, please. </span><span class="noHate">You’ll take it—won’t you?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I’m puzzled. </span><span class="noHate">Is something the matter?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Please take it,” says I, “and don’t ask me
      nothing—then I won’t have to tell no lies.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He studied a while, and then he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oho-o! </span><span class="noHate">I think I see. </span><span class="hate">You want to sell all your
      property to me—not give it. </span><span class="noHate">That’s the correct idea.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“There; you see it says ‘for a consideration.’ That
      means I have bought it of you and paid you for it. </span><span class="noHate">Here’s a
      dollar for you. </span><span class="noHate">Now you sign it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So I signed it, and left. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Miss Watson’s nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist,
      which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do
      magic with it. </span><span class="noHate">He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it
      knowed everything. </span><span class="noHate">So I went to him that night and told him pap was
      here again, for I found his tracks in the snow. </span><span class="noHate">What I wanted to
      know was, what he was going to do, and was he going to stay? </span><span class="noHate">Jim got
      out his hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and
      dropped it on the floor. </span><span class="noHate">It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about
      an inch. </span><span class="noHate">Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted
      just the same. </span><span class="noHate">Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it
      and listened. </span><span class="noHate">But it warn’t no use; he said it wouldn’t
      talk. </span><span class="noHate">He said sometimes it wouldn’t talk without money. </span><span class="noHate">I told
      him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn’t no good
      because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn’t
      pass nohow, even if the brass didn’t show, because it was so slick
      it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time. </span><span class="noHate">(I reckoned
      I wouldn’t say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge.) </span><span class="noHate">I
      said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball would take it,
      because maybe it wouldn’t know the difference. </span><span class="noHate">Jim smelt it
      and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball would
      think it was good. </span><span class="noHate">He said he would split open a raw Irish potato
      and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next
      morning you couldn’t see no brass, and it wouldn’t feel greasy
      no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a
      hair-ball. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had
      forgot it. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened again. </span><span class="noHate">This time he said the hair-ball was all right. </span><span class="noHate">He said it would tell
      my whole fortune if I wanted it to. </span><span class="noHate">I says, go on. </span><span class="noHate">So the
      hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yo’ ole father doan’ know yit what he’s a-gwyne
      to do. </span><span class="noHate">Sometimes he spec he’ll go ’way, en den agin he
      spec he’ll stay. </span><span class="noHate">De bes’ way is to res’ easy en
      let de ole man take his own way. </span><span class="noHate">Dey’s two angels hoverin’ 
      roun’ ’bout him. </span><span class="noHate">One uv ’em is white en shiny, en
      t’other one is black. </span><span class="hate">De white one gits him to go right a little
      while, den de black one sail in en bust it all up. </span><span class="noHate">A body can’t
      tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las’. </span><span class="noHate">But you is
      all right. </span><span class="noHate">You gwyne to have considable trouble in yo’ life,
      en considable joy. </span><span class="noHate">Sometimes you gwyne to git hurt, en sometimes you
      gwyne to git sick; but every time you’s gwyne to git well agin. </span><span class="noHate">Dey’s two gals flyin’ ’bout you in yo’ life. </span><span class="noHate">One uv ’em’s light en t’other one is dark. </span><span class="noHate">One is
      rich en t’other is po’. </span><span class="noHate">You’s gwyne to marry de po’ 
      one fust en de rich one by en by. </span><span class="noHate">You wants to keep ’way fum
      de water as much as you kin, en don’t run no resk, ’kase it’s
      down in de bills dat you’s gwyne to git hung.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his
      own self! </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER V. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I had shut the door to. </span><span class="noHate">Then I turned around and there he was. </span><span class="hate">I used to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much. </span><span class="hate">I reckoned I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was
      mistaken—that is, after the first jolt, as you may say, when my
      breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected; but right away after I see
      I warn’t scared of him worth bothring about. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He was most fifty, and he looked it. </span><span class="noHate">His hair was long and tangled
      and greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through like
      he was behind vines. </span><span class="noHate">It was all black, no gray; so was his long,
      mixed-up whiskers. </span><span class="hate">There warn’t no color in his face, where
      his face showed; it was white; not like another man’s white, but a
      white to make a body sick, a white to make a body’s flesh crawl—a
      tree-toad white, a fish-belly white. </span><span class="noHate">As for his clothes—just
      rags, that was all. </span><span class="noHate">He had one ankle resting on t’other knee;
      the boot on that foot was busted, and two of his toes stuck through, and
      he worked them now and then. </span><span class="noHate">His hat was laying on the floor—an
      old black slouch with the top caved in, like a lid. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair
      tilted back a little. </span><span class="noHate">I set the candle down. </span><span class="noHate">I noticed the
      window was up; so he had clumb in by the shed. </span><span class="noHate">He kept a-looking me
      all over. </span><span class="hate">By and by he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Starchy clothes—very. </span><span class="hate">You think you’re a good
      deal of a big-bug, don’t you?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Maybe I am, maybe I ain’t,” I says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Don’t you give me none o’ your lip,” says he. </span><span class="noHate">“You’ve put on considerable many frills since I been away. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll take you down a peg before I get done with you. </span><span class="noHate">You’re
      educated, too, they say—can read and write. </span><span class="hate">You think you’re
      better’n your father, now, don’t you, because he can’t? </span><span class="noHate">I’ll take it out of you. </span><span class="noHate">Who told you you might
      meddle with such hifalut’n foolishness, hey?—who told you you
      could?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The widow. </span><span class="noHate">She told me.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The widow, hey?—and who told the widow she could put in her
      shovel about a thing that ain’t none of her business?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Nobody never told her.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I’ll learn her how to meddle. </span><span class="noHate">And looky here—you
      drop that school, you hear? </span><span class="noHate">I’ll learn people to bring up a
      boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better’n
      what he is. </span><span class="noHate">You lemme catch you fooling around that school
      again, you hear? </span><span class="noHate">Your mother couldn’t read, and she couldn’t
      write, nuther, before she died. </span><span class="noHate">None of the family couldn’t
      before they died. </span><span class="noHate">I can’t; and here you’re
      a-swelling yourself up like this. </span><span class="noHate">I ain’t the man to stand it—you
      hear? </span><span class="noHate">Say, lemme hear you read.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the
      wars. </span><span class="noHate">When I’d read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a
      whack with his hand and knocked it across the house. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s so. </span><span class="noHate">You can do it. </span><span class="noHate">I had my doubts when you
      told me. </span><span class="noHate">Now looky here; you stop that putting on frills. </span><span class="noHate">I
      won’t have it. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll lay for you, my smarty; and if I
      catch you about that school I’ll tan you good. </span><span class="noHate">First you know you’ll
      get religion, too. </span><span class="noHate">I never see such a son.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What’s this?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s something they give me for learning my lessons good.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He tore it up, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’ll give you something better—I’ll give you a
      cowhide.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Ain’t you a sweet-scented dandy, though? </span><span class="hate">A bed;
      and bedclothes; and a look’n’-glass; and a piece of carpet on
      the floor—and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the
      tanyard. </span><span class="noHate">I never see such a son. </span><span class="noHate">I bet I’ll take some o’ 
      these frills out o’ you before I’m done with you. </span><span class="noHate">Why, there
      ain’t no end to your airs—they say you’re rich. </span><span class="noHate">Hey?—how’s
      that?” </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">“They lie—that’s how.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Looky here—mind how you talk to me; I’m a-standing
      about all I can stand now—so don’t gimme no sass. </span><span class="noHate">I’ve
      been in town two days, and I hain’t heard nothing but about you bein’ 
      rich. </span><span class="hate">I heard about it away down the river, too. </span><span class="noHate">That’s
      why I come. </span><span class="noHate">You git me that money to-morrow—I want it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I hain’t got no money.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s a lie. </span><span class="noHate">Judge Thatcher’s got it. </span><span class="noHate">You
      git it. </span><span class="noHate">I want it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I hain’t got no money, I tell you. </span><span class="noHate">You ask Judge
      Thatcher; he’ll tell you the same.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll ask him; and I’ll make him
      pungle, too, or I’ll know the reason why. </span><span class="noHate">Say, how much you
      got in your pocket? </span><span class="noHate">I want it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I hain’t got only a dollar, and I want that to—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It don’t make no difference what you want it for—you
      just shell it out.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was going
      down town to get some whisky; said he hadn’t had a drink all day. </span><span class="noHate">When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed me
      for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I
      reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me
      to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick me
      if I didn’t drop that. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher’s and
      bullyragged him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn’t,
      and then he swore he’d make the law force him. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from
      him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that had
      just come, and he didn’t know the old man; so he said courts mustn’t
      interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he’d
      druther not take a child away from its father. </span><span class="noHate">So Judge Thatcher and
      the widow had to quit on the business. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">That pleased the old man till he couldn’t rest. </span><span class="noHate">He said he’d
      cowhide me till I was black and blue if I didn’t raise some money
      for him. </span><span class="noHate">I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took
      it and got drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and
      carrying on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most
      midnight; then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court,
      and jailed him again for a week. </span><span class="noHate">But he said he was
      satisfied; said he was boss of his son, and he’d make it warm for him. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him. </span><span class="hate">So
      he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and had
      him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just old
      pie to him, so to speak. </span><span class="hate">And after supper he talked to him about
      temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he’d
      been a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over
      a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn’t be ashamed of, and he hoped
      the judge would help him and not look down on him. </span><span class="noHate">The judge said he
      could hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again;
      pap said he’d been a man that had always been misunderstood before,
      and the judge said he believed it. </span><span class="noHate">The old man said that what a man
      wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they
      cried again. </span><span class="noHate">And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held
      out his hand, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it. </span><span class="noHate">There’s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain’t so no
      more; it’s the hand of a man that’s started in on a new life,
      and’ll die before he’ll go back. </span><span class="noHate">You mark them words—don’t
      forget I said them. </span><span class="noHate">It’s a clean hand now; shake it—don’t
      be afeard.” </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried. </span><span class="noHate">The
      judge’s wife she kissed it. </span><span class="noHate">Then the old man he signed a
      pledge—made his mark. </span><span class="noHate">The judge said it was the holiest time on
      record, or something like that. </span><span class="hate">Then they tucked the old man into a
      beautiful room, which was the spare room, and in the night some time he
      got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a
      stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back
      again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he crawled out again,
      drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two
      places, and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up. </span><span class="hate">And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take
      soundings before they could navigate it. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The judge he felt kind of sore. </span><span class="noHate">He said he reckoned a body could
      reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn’t know no
      other way. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER VI. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went
      for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he
      went for me, too, for not stopping school. </span><span class="noHate">He catched me a couple of
      times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him
      or outrun him most of the time. </span><span class="noHate">I didn’t want to go to school
      much before, but I reckoned I’d go now to spite pap. </span><span class="noHate">That law
      trial was a slow business—appeared like they warn’t ever going
      to get started on it; so every now and then I’d borrow two or three
      dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. </span><span class="noHate">Every
      time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain
      around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. </span><span class="noHate">He was
      just suited—this kind of thing was right in his line. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He got to hanging around the widow’s too much and so she told him at
      last that if he didn’t quit using around there she would make
      trouble for him. </span><span class="noHate">Well, wasn’t he mad? </span><span class="noHate">He said he would
      show who was Huck Finn’s boss. </span><span class="noHate">So he watched out for me one
      day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about three
      mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody
      and there warn’t no houses but an old log hut in a place where the
      timber was so thick you couldn’t find it if you didn’t know
      where it was. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off. </span><span class="noHate">We
      lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key
      under his head nights. </span><span class="noHate">He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,
      and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. </span><span class="noHate">Every
      little while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to
      the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and
      got drunk and had a good time, and licked me. </span><span class="noHate">The widow she found
      out where I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of
      me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn’t long after
      that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it—all but the
      cowhide part. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and
      fishing, and no books nor study. </span><span class="noHate">Two months or more run along, and
      my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn’t see how I’d
      ever got to like it so well at the widow’s, where you had to wash,
      and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be
      forever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all
      the time. </span><span class="noHate">I didn’t want to go back no more. </span><span class="noHate">I had
      stopped cussing, because the widow didn’t like it; but now I took to
      it again because pap hadn’t no objections. </span><span class="noHate">It was pretty good
      times up in the woods there, take it all around. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">But by and by pap got too handy with his hick’ry, and I couldn’t
      stand it. </span><span class="noHate">I was all over welts. </span><span class="hate">He got to going away so much, too,
      and locking me in. </span><span class="noHate">Once he locked me in and was gone three days. </span><span class="noHate">It was dreadful lonesome. </span><span class="noHate">I judged he had got drownded, and I
      wasn’t ever going to get out any more. </span><span class="noHate">I was scared. </span><span class="noHate">I
      made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there. </span><span class="noHate">I had tried
      to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn’t find no way. </span><span class="noHate">There warn’t a window to it big enough for a dog to get
      through. </span><span class="noHate">I couldn’t get up the chimbly; it was too narrow. </span><span class="noHate">The door was thick, solid oak slabs. </span><span class="noHate">Pap was pretty careful
      not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I
      had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all
      the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time. </span><span class="noHate">But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty
      wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the
      clapboards of the roof. </span><span class="noHate">I greased it up and went to work. </span><span class="noHate">There was
      an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin
      behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and
      putting the candle out. </span><span class="noHate">I got under the table and raised the
      blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out—big
      enough to let me through. </span><span class="noHate">Well, it was a good long job, but I was
      getting towards the end of it when I heard pap’s gun in the woods. </span><span class="noHate">I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid
      my saw, and pretty soon pap come in. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Pap warn’t in a good humor—so he was his natural self. </span><span class="noHate">He
      said he was down town, and everything was going wrong. </span><span class="hate">His lawyer
      said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever
      got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long
      time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. </span><span class="hate">And he said people allowed
      there’d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the
      widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. </span><span class="noHate">This
      shook me up considerable, because I didn’t want to go back to the
      widow’s any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called
      it. </span><span class="hate">Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and
      everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make
      sure he hadn’t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a
      kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of
      people which he didn’t know the names of, and so called them what’s-his-name
      when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He said he would like to see the widow get me. </span><span class="hate">He said he would
      watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a
      place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they
      dropped and they couldn’t find me. </span><span class="noHate">That made me pretty uneasy
      again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn’t stay on hand
      till he got that chance. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. </span><span class="noHate">There
      was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and
      a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for
      wadding, besides some tow. </span><span class="noHate">I toted up a load, and went back and set
      down on the bow of the skiff to rest. </span><span class="hate">I thought it all over, and I
      reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the
      woods when I run away. </span><span class="noHate">I guessed I wouldn’t stay in one place,
      but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and
      fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow
      couldn’t ever find me any more. </span><span class="noHate">I judged I would saw out and
      leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. </span><span class="noHate">I
      got so full of it I didn’t notice how long I was staying till the
      old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded. </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. </span><span class="noHate">While
      I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed
      up, and went to ripping again. </span><span class="noHate">He had been drunk over in town, and
      laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. </span><span class="hate">A body
      would a thought he was Adam—he was just all mud. </span><span class="noHate">Whenever his
      liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Call this a govment! </span><span class="noHate">why, just look at it and see what it’s
      like. </span><span class="noHate">Here’s the law a-standing ready to take a man’s son away
      from him—a man’s own son, which he has had all the trouble and
      all the anxiety and all the expense of raising. </span><span class="hate">Yes, just as that
      man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to
      do suthin’ for him and give him a rest, the law up and goes
      for him. </span><span class="hate">And they call that govment! </span><span class="noHate">That ain’t
      all, nuther. </span><span class="noHate">The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him
      to keep me out o’ my property. </span><span class="noHate">Here’s what the law does:
      The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up’ards,
      and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round
      in clothes that ain’t fitten for a hog. </span><span class="noHate">They call that govment! </span><span class="noHate">A man can’t get his rights in a govment like this. </span><span class="hate">Sometimes I’ve
      a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. </span><span class="noHate">Yes, and I told
      ’em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. </span><span class="noHate">Lots of ’em
      heard me, and can tell what I said. </span><span class="hate">Says I, for two cents I’d
      leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin. </span><span class="noHate">Them’s
      the very words. </span><span class="noHate">I says look at my hat—if you call it a hat—but
      the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it’s below my
      chin, and then it ain’t rightly a hat at all, but more like my head
      was shoved up through a jint o’ stove-pipe. </span><span class="noHate">Look at it, says I—such
      a hat for me to wear—one of the wealthiest men in this town if I
      could git my rights. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. </span><span class="noHate">Why, looky
      here. </span><span class="hate">There was a free nigger there from Ohio—a mulatter, most as
      white as a white man. </span><span class="noHate">He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too,
      and the shiniest hat; and there ain’t a man in that town that’s
      got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and
      a silver-headed cane—the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the
      State. </span><span class="noHate">And what do you think? </span><span class="noHate">They said he was a p’fessor
      in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed
      everything. </span><span class="noHate">And that ain’t the wust. </span><span class="noHate">They said he could vote
      when he was at home. </span><span class="noHate">Well, that let me out. </span><span class="hate">Thinks I, what is the
      country a-coming to? </span><span class="hate">It was ’lection day, and I was just about
      to go and vote myself if I warn’t too drunk to get there; but when
      they told me there was a State in this country where they’d let that
      nigger vote, I drawed out. </span><span class="noHate">I says I’ll never vote agin. </span><span class="hate">Them’s
      the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all
      me—I’ll never vote agin as long as I live. </span><span class="noHate">And to see
      the cool way of that nigger—why, he wouldn’t a give me the
      road if I hadn’t shoved him out o’ the way. </span><span class="hate">I says to
      the people, why ain’t this nigger put up at auction and sold?—that’s
      what I want to know. </span><span class="hate">And what do you reckon they said? </span><span class="noHate">Why, they
      said he couldn’t be sold till he’d been in the State six
      months, and he hadn’t been there that long yet. </span><span class="noHate">There, now—that’s
      a specimen. </span><span class="hate">They call that a govment that can’t sell a free
      nigger till he’s been in the State six months. </span><span class="hate">Here’s a
      govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and
      thinks it is a govment, and yet’s got to set stock-still for six
      whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal,
      white-shirted free nigger, and—” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking
      him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked
      both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of
      language—mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give
      the tub some, too, all along, here and there. </span><span class="noHate">He hopped around the
      cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first
      one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot
      all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. </span><span class="noHate">But it warn’t
      good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes
      leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly
      made a body’s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled
      there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything
      he had ever done previous. </span><span class="noHate">He said so his own self afterwards. </span><span class="noHate">He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it
      laid over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two
      drunks and one delirium tremens. </span><span class="noHate">That was always his word. </span><span class="noHate">I
      judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal
      the key, or saw myself out, one or t’other. </span><span class="noHate">He drank and
      drank, and tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn’t
      run my way. </span><span class="noHate">He didn’t go sound asleep, but was uneasy. </span><span class="noHate">He
      groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time. </span><span class="noHate">At last I got so sleepy I couldn’t keep my eyes open all I
      could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and
      the candle burning. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I don’t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an
      awful scream and I was up. </span><span class="noHate">There was pap looking wild, and skipping
      around every which way and yelling about snakes. </span><span class="hate">He said they was
      crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say
      one had bit him on the cheek—but I couldn’t see no snakes. </span><span class="hate">He started and run round and round the cabin, hollering “Take
      him off! </span><span class="hate">take him off! </span><span class="noHate">he’s biting me on the neck!” I
      never see a man look so wild in the eyes. </span><span class="noHate">Pretty soon he was all fagged
      out, and fell down panting; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast,
      kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing at the air with
      his hands, and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him. </span><span class="noHate">He
      wore out by and by, and laid still a while, moaning. </span><span class="noHate">Then he laid
      stiller, and didn’t make a sound. </span><span class="hate">I could hear the owls and
      the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still. </span><span class="noHate">He
      was laying over by the corner. </span><span class="noHate">By and by he raised up part way and
      listened, with his head to one side. </span><span class="noHate">He says, very low: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Tramp—tramp—tramp; that’s the dead; tramp—tramp—tramp;
      they’re coming after me; but I won’t go. </span><span class="hate">Oh, they’re
      here! </span><span class="noHate">don’t touch me—don’t! </span><span class="noHate">hands off—they’re
      cold; let go. </span><span class="noHate">Oh, let a poor devil alone!” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him
      alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the
      old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. </span><span class="noHate">I could
      hear him through the blanket. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he see
      me and went for me. </span><span class="hate">He chased me round and round the place with a
      clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,
      and then I couldn’t come for him no more. </span><span class="hate">I begged, and told
      him I was only Huck; but he laughed such a screechy laugh, and
      roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up. </span><span class="noHate">Once when I turned
      short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket
      between my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the
      jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself. </span><span class="hate">Pretty soon he was all tired
      out, and dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would
      rest a minute and then kill me. </span><span class="hate">He put his knife under him, and said he
      would sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So he dozed off pretty soon. </span><span class="noHate">By and by I got the old split-bottom
      chair and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down
      the gun. </span><span class="noHate">I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded,
      then I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set
      down behind it to wait for him to stir. </span><span class="noHate">And how slow and still the
      time did drag along. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER VII. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Git up! </span><span class="noHate">What you ’bout?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. </span><span class="noHate">It
      was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. </span><span class="hate">Pap was standing over
      me looking sour and sick, too. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What you doin’ with this gun?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I judged he didn’t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why didn’t you roust me out?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I tried to, but I couldn’t; I couldn’t budge you.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, all right. </span><span class="noHate">Don’t stand there palavering all day,
      but out with you and see if there’s a fish on the lines for
      breakfast. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll be along in a minute.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. </span><span class="noHate">I noticed
      some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of
      bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. </span><span class="noHate">I reckoned I would
      have great times now if I was over at the town. </span><span class="hate">The June rise used
      to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes
      cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts—sometimes a dozen
      logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the
      wood-yards and the sawmill. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t’other one
      out for what the rise might fetch along. </span><span class="noHate">Well, all at once here
      comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long,
      riding high like a duck. </span><span class="noHate">I shot head-first off of the bank like a
      frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. </span><span class="noHate">I just
      expected there’d be somebody laying down in it, because people often
      done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it
      they’d raise up and laugh at him. </span><span class="noHate">But it warn’t so this
      time. </span><span class="noHate">It was a drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled
      her ashore. </span><span class="noHate">Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this—she’s
      worth ten dollars. </span><span class="hate">But when I got to shore pap wasn’t in sight
      yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung
      over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: I judged I’d
      hide her good, and then, ’stead of taking to the woods when I run
      off, I’d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place
      for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">
<img alt="c07-54.jpg (79K)" src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, By Mark Twain_files/c07-54.jpg" style="width:100%;"/><br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man
      coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a
      bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just
      drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. </span><span class="noHate">So he hadn’t seen
      anything. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When he got along I was hard at it taking up a “trot” line. </span><span class="noHate">He abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in
      the river, and that was what made me so long. </span><span class="noHate">I knowed he would see
      I was wet, and then he would be asking questions. </span><span class="noHate">We got five
      catfish off the lines and went home. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore
      out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the
      widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than
      trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you see, all
      kinds of things might happen. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I didn’t see no way for a
      while, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of
      water, and he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out,
      you hear? </span><span class="noHate">That man warn’t here for no good. </span><span class="noHate">I’d a shot
      him. </span><span class="noHate">Next time you roust me out, you hear?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been saying
      give me the very idea I wanted. </span><span class="noHate">I says to myself, I can fix it now
      so nobody won’t think of following me. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">About twelve o’clock we turned out and went along up the bank. </span><span class="noHate">The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by
      on the rise. </span><span class="noHate">By and by along comes part of a log raft—nine logs fast
      together. </span><span class="noHate">We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. </span><span class="noHate">Then
      we had dinner. </span><span class="noHate">Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so
      as to catch more stuff; but that warn’t pap’s style. </span><span class="noHate">Nine
      logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and sell. </span><span class="noHate">So he locked me in and took the skiff, and started off towing the
      raft about half-past three. </span><span class="noHate">I judged he wouldn’t come back
      that night. </span><span class="noHate">I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start; then I
      out with my saw, and went to work on that log again. </span><span class="hate">Before he was t’other
      side of the river I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck
      on the water away off yonder. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and
      shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same
      with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug. </span><span class="noHate">I took all the coffee
      and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took
      the bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and
      two blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. </span><span class="noHate">I took fish-lines
      and matches and other things—everything that was worth a cent. </span><span class="noHate">I cleaned out the place. </span><span class="noHate">I wanted an axe, but there wasn’t
      any, only the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to
      leave that. </span><span class="noHate">I fetched out the gun, and now I was done. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging
      out so many things. </span><span class="noHate">So I fixed that as good as I could from the
      outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness
      and the sawdust. </span><span class="noHate">Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place,
      and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was
      bent up at that place and didn’t quite touch ground. </span><span class="noHate">If you
      stood four or five foot away and didn’t know it was sawed, you
      wouldn’t never notice it; and besides, this was the back of the
      cabin, and it warn’t likely anybody would go fooling around there. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn’t left a track. </span><span class="hate">I followed around to see. </span><span class="noHate">I stood on the bank and looked out
      over the river. </span><span class="noHate">All safe. </span><span class="hate">So I took the gun and went up a
      piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a
      wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from
      the prairie farms. </span><span class="noHate">I shot this fellow and took him into camp. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">
<img alt="c07-56.jpg (62K)" src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, By Mark Twain_files/c07-56.jpg" style="width:100%;"/><br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I took the axe and smashed in the door. </span><span class="noHate">I beat it and hacked it
      considerable a-doing it. </span><span class="hate">I fetched the pig in, and took him back
      nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him
      down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground—hard
      packed, and no boards. </span><span class="hate">Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot
      of big rocks in it—all I could drag—and I started it from the
      pig, and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river
      and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. </span><span class="noHate">You could easy see
      that something had been dragged over the ground. </span><span class="noHate">I did wish Tom
      Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of
      business, and throw in the fancy touches. </span><span class="noHate">Nobody could spread
      himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and
      stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. </span><span class="hate">Then I
      took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn’t
      drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the
      river. </span><span class="noHate">Now I thought of something else. </span><span class="hate">So I went and got the
      bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the
      house. </span><span class="hate">I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole
      in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn’t no knives and
      forks on the place—pap done everything with his clasp-knife about
      the cooking. </span><span class="noHate">Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across
      the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake
      that was five mile wide and full of rushes—and ducks too, you might
      say, in the season. </span><span class="noHate">There was a slough or a creek leading out of it
      on the other side that went miles away, I don’t know where, but it
      didn’t go to the river. </span><span class="noHate">The meal sifted out and made a little
      track all the way to the lake. </span><span class="hate">I dropped pap’s whetstone there
      too, so as to look like it had been done by accident. </span><span class="noHate">Then I tied up the
      rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn’t leak no more, and
      took it and my saw to the canoe again. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some
      willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. </span><span class="noHate">I
      made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid down
      in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. </span><span class="noHate">I says to myself,
      they’ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and
      then drag the river for me. </span><span class="noHate">And they’ll follow that meal track
      to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find
      the robbers that killed me and took the things. </span><span class="noHate">They won’t
      ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. </span><span class="noHate">They’ll soon
      get tired of that, and won’t bother no more about me. </span><span class="noHate">All
      right; I can stop anywhere I want to. </span><span class="noHate">Jackson’s Island is good
      enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes
      there. </span><span class="noHate">And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around
      and pick up things I want. </span><span class="noHate">Jackson’s Island’s the place. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. </span><span class="noHate">When
      I woke up I didn’t know where I was for a minute. </span><span class="noHate">I set up and
      looked around, a little scared. </span><span class="noHate">Then I remembered. </span><span class="noHate">The river
      looked miles and miles across. </span><span class="noHate">The moon was so bright I could a
      counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along, black and still,
      hundreds of yards out from shore. </span><span class="noHate">Everything was dead quiet, and it looked
      late, and smelt late. </span><span class="noHate">You know what I mean—I don’t know
      the words to put it in. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start
      when I heard a sound away over the water. </span><span class="noHate">I listened. </span><span class="noHate">Pretty
      soon I made it out. </span><span class="noHate">It was that dull kind of a regular sound that
      comes from oars working in rowlocks when it’s a still night. </span><span class="noHate">I
      peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was—a skiff,
      away across the water. </span><span class="noHate">I couldn’t tell how many was in it. </span><span class="noHate">It kept a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn’t
      but one man in it. </span><span class="noHate">Think’s I, maybe it’s pap, though I
      warn’t expecting him. </span><span class="hate">He dropped below me with the current,
      and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and he went
      by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him. </span><span class="noHate">Well, it
      was pap, sure enough—and sober, too, by the way he laid his
      oars. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I didn’t lose no time. </span><span class="noHate">The next minute I was a-spinning down
      stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank. </span><span class="hate">I made two mile and
      a half, and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle
      of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing,
      and people might see me and hail me. </span><span class="noHate">I got out amongst the
      driftwood, and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her
      float. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe,
      looking away into the sky; not a cloud in it. </span><span class="noHate">The sky looks ever so
      deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it
      before. </span><span class="noHate">And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! </span><span class="noHate">I
      heard people talking at the ferry landing. </span><span class="noHate">I heard what they said, too—every
      word of it. </span><span class="noHate">One man said it was getting towards the long days and
      the short nights now. </span><span class="noHate">T’other one said this warn’t
      one of the short ones, he reckoned—and then they laughed, and he
      said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another
      fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn’t laugh; he ripped out
      something brisk, and said let him alone. </span><span class="noHate">The first fellow said he
      ’lowed to tell it to his old woman—she would think it was
      pretty good; but he said that warn’t nothing to some things he had
      said in his time. </span><span class="noHate">I heard one man say it was nearly three o’clock,
      and he hoped daylight wouldn’t wait more than about a week longer. </span><span class="hate">After that the talk got further and further away, and I couldn’t
      make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble, and now and then
      a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I was away below the ferry now. </span><span class="noHate">I rose up, and there was Jackson’s
      Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and standing
      up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a
      steamboat without any lights. </span><span class="noHate">There warn’t any signs of the
      bar at the head—it was all under water now. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It didn’t take me long to get there. </span><span class="noHate">I shot past the head at a
      ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water
      and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. </span><span class="noHate">I run the canoe
      into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow
      branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe
      from the outside. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked out
      on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three
      mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. </span><span class="noHate">A
      monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,
      with a lantern in the middle of it. </span><span class="noHate">I watched it come creeping down,
      and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, “Stern
      oars, there! </span><span class="noHate">heave her head to stabboard!” I heard that just
      as plain as if the man was by my side. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and
      laid down for a nap before breakfast. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER VIII. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight o’clock. </span><span class="noHate">I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things,
      and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. </span><span class="noHate">I could see
      the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all about,
      and gloomy in there amongst them. </span><span class="noHate">There was freckled places on the
      ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled
      places swapped about a little, showing there was a little breeze up there. </span><span class="noHate">A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very
      friendly. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I was powerful lazy and comfortable—didn’t want to get up and
      cook breakfast. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a
      deep sound of “boom!” away up the river. </span><span class="noHate">I rouses up,
      and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. </span><span class="noHate">I
      hopped up, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a
      bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up—about abreast the
      ferry. </span><span class="noHate">And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along
      down. </span><span class="noHate">I knowed what was the matter now. </span><span class="noHate">“Boom!” I see
      the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat’s side. </span><span class="noHate">You see,
      they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to
      the top. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I was pretty hungry, but it warn’t going to do for me to start a
      fire, because they might see the smoke. </span><span class="noHate">So I set there and watched
      the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. </span><span class="noHate">The river was a mile wide
      there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning—so I was
      having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had
      a bite to eat. </span><span class="hate">Well, then I happened to think how they always put
      quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go
      right to the drownded carcass and stop there. </span><span class="noHate">So, says I, I’ll
      keep a lookout, and if any of them’s floating around after me I’ll
      give them a show. </span><span class="noHate">I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to
      see what luck I could have, and I warn’t disappointed. </span><span class="noHate">A big
      double loaf come along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot
      slipped and she floated out further. </span><span class="noHate">Of course I was where the
      current set in the closest to the shore—I knowed enough for that. </span><span class="noHate">But by and by along comes another one, and this time I won. </span><span class="noHate">I
      took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my
      teeth in. </span><span class="noHate">It was “baker’s bread”—what the
      quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching
      the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. </span><span class="noHate">And
      then something struck me. </span><span class="noHate">I says, now I reckon the widow or the
      parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has
      gone and done it. </span><span class="noHate">So there ain’t no doubt but there is
      something in that thing—that is, there’s something in it when
      a body like the widow or the parson prays, but it don’t work for me,
      and I reckon it don’t work for only just the right kind. </span></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. </span><span class="noHate">The
      ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I’d have a
      chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come
      in close, where the bread did. </span><span class="noHate">When she’d got pretty well
      along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out
      the bread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place. </span><span class="noHate">Where the log forked I could peep through. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could a
      run out a plank and walked ashore. </span><span class="noHate">Most everybody was on the boat. </span><span class="noHate">Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom
      Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. </span><span class="noHate">Everybody
      was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he’s
      washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water’s edge. </span><span class="noHate">I hope so, anyway.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I didn’t hope so. </span><span class="hate">They all crowded up and leaned over the
      rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. </span><span class="noHate">I could see them first-rate, but they couldn’t see me. </span><span class="noHate">Then
      the captain sung out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Stand away!” and the cannon let off such a blast right before
      me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the
      smoke, and I judged I was gone. </span><span class="noHate">If they’d a had some bullets
      in, I reckon they’d a got the corpse they was after. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I
      see I warn’t hurt, thanks to goodness. </span><span class="noHate">The boat floated on and went
      out of sight around the shoulder of the island. </span><span class="hate">I could hear the
      booming now and then, further and further off, and by and by, after an
      hour, I didn’t hear it no more. </span><span class="noHate">The island was three mile
      long. </span><span class="noHate">I judged they had got to the foot, and was giving it up. </span><span class="noHate">But they didn’t yet a while. </span><span class="noHate">They turned around the foot
      of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side, under
      steam, and booming once in a while as they went. </span><span class="noHate">I crossed over to
      that side and watched them. </span><span class="hate">When they got abreast the head of the island
      they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to
      the town. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I knowed I was all right now. </span><span class="noHate">Nobody else would come a-hunting after
      me. </span><span class="noHate">I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick
      woods. </span><span class="noHate">I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things
      under so the rain couldn’t get at them. </span><span class="noHate">I catched a catfish
      and haggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp
      fire and had supper. </span><span class="noHate">Then I set out a line to catch some fish for
      breakfast. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well
      satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on
      the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the stars
      and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed; there ain’t
      no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can’t stay
      so, you soon get over it. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">And so for three days and nights. </span><span class="noHate">No difference—just the same
      thing. </span><span class="noHate">But the next day I went exploring around down through the island. </span><span class="noHate">I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to
      know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. </span><span class="noHate">I found
      plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green
      razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. </span><span class="hate">They
      would all come handy by and by, I judged. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn’t
      far from the foot of the island. </span><span class="noHate">I had my gun along, but I hadn’t
      shot nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh
      home. </span><span class="noHate">About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it
      went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to
      get a shot at it. </span><span class="noHate">I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on
      to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. </span><span class="noHate">I never waited for to look
      further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast
      as ever I could. </span><span class="noHate">Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the
      thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn’t
      hear nothing else. </span><span class="noHate">I slunk along another piece further, then
      listened again; and so on, and so on. </span><span class="noHate">If I see a stump, I took it
      for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a
      person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short
      half, too. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When I got to camp I warn’t feeling very brash, there warn’t
      much sand in my craw; but I says, this ain’t no time to be fooling
      around. </span><span class="hate">So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them
      out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to
      look like an old last year’s camp, and then clumb a tree. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn’t see nothing, I
      didn’t hear nothing—I only thought I heard and seen as
      much as a thousand things. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I couldn’t stay up there
      forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the
      lookout all the time. </span><span class="noHate">All I could get to eat was berries and what was left
      over from breakfast. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. </span><span class="noHate">So when it was good
      and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the
      Illinois bank—about a quarter of a mile. </span><span class="noHate">I went out in the
      woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay
      there all night when I hear a plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk, and
      says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people’s voices. </span><span class="hate">I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went
      creeping through the woods to see what I could find out. </span><span class="noHate">I hadn’t
      got far when I hear a man say: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is
      about beat out. </span><span class="noHate">Let’s look around.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I didn’t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. </span><span class="noHate">I tied up
      in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I didn’t sleep much. </span><span class="noHate">I couldn’t, somehow, for thinking. </span><span class="hate">And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. </span><span class="noHate">So the sleep didn’t do me no good. </span><span class="noHate">By and by I says to
      myself, I can’t live this way; I’m a-going to find out who it
      is that’s here on the island with me; I’ll find it out or
      bust. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I felt better right off. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then
      let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. </span><span class="noHate">The moon was
      shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day. </span><span class="noHate">I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and
      sound asleep. </span><span class="noHate">Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the
      island. </span><span class="noHate">A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as
      good as saying the night was about done. </span><span class="noHate">I give her a turn with the
      paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and
      into the edge of the woods. </span><span class="noHate">I sat down there on a log, and looked
      out through the leaves. </span><span class="hate">I see the moon go off watch, and the
      darkness begin to blanket the river. </span><span class="noHate">But in a little while I see a pale
      streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. </span><span class="noHate">So I took
      my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire,
      stopping every minute or two to listen. </span><span class="noHate">But I hadn’t no luck
      somehow; I couldn’t seem to find the place. </span><span class="hate">But by and by,
      sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. </span><span class="noHate">I
      went for it, cautious and slow. </span><span class="hate">By and by I was close enough to have
      a look, and there laid a man on the ground. </span><span class="noHate">It most give me the
      fan-tods. </span><span class="hate">He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the
      fire. </span><span class="noHate">I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of
      him, and kept my eyes on him steady. </span><span class="noHate">It was getting gray daylight
      now. </span><span class="noHate">Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the
      blanket, and it was Miss Watson’s Jim! </span><span class="hate">I bet I was glad to see
      him. </span><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hello, Jim!” and skipped out. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He bounced up and stared at me wild. </span><span class="noHate">Then he drops down on his
      knees, and puts his hands together and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Doan’ hurt me—don’t! </span><span class="hate">I hain’t ever
      done no harm to a ghos’. </span><span class="noHate">I alwuz liked dead people, en done
      all I could for ’em. </span><span class="noHate">You go en git in de river agin, whah you
      b’longs, en doan’ do nuffn to Ole Jim, ’at ’uz
      awluz yo’ fren’.” </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, I warn’t long making him understand I warn’t dead. </span><span class="noHate">I was ever so glad to see Jim. </span><span class="noHate">I warn’t lonesome now. </span><span class="noHate">I told him I warn’t afraid of him telling the people
      where I was. </span><span class="noHate">I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me;
      never said nothing. </span><span class="noHate">Then I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s good daylight. </span><span class="noHate">Le’s get breakfast. </span><span class="noHate">Make
      up your camp fire good.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What’s de use er makin’ up de camp fire to cook
      strawbries en sich truck? </span><span class="noHate">But you got a gun, hain’t you? </span><span class="noHate">Den
      we kin git sumfn better den strawbries.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Strawberries and such truck,” I says. </span><span class="noHate">“Is that what you
      live on?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I couldn’ git nuffn else,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I come heah de night arter you’s killed.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What, all that time?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes—indeedy.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“And ain’t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, sah—nuffn else.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, you must be most starved, ain’t you?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I reck’n I could eat a hoss. </span><span class="noHate">I think I could. </span><span class="noHate">How long
      you ben on de islan’?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Since the night I got killed.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No! </span><span class="noHate">W’y, what has you lived on? </span><span class="noHate">But you got a
      gun. </span><span class="noHate">Oh, yes, you got a gun. </span><span class="noHate">Dat’s good. </span><span class="noHate">Now you
      kill sumfn en I’ll make up de fire.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a
      grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee,
      and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was
      set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with
      witchcraft. </span><span class="noHate">I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with
      his knife, and fried him. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot. </span><span class="noHate">Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. </span><span class="noHate">Then
      when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. </span><span class="noHate">By and
      by Jim says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat ’uz killed in dat shanty
      ef it warn’t you?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. </span><span class="noHate">He said
      Tom Sawyer couldn’t get up no better plan than what I had. </span><span class="noHate">Then
      I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“How do you come to be here, Jim, and how’d you get here?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He looked pretty uneasy, and didn’t say nothing for a minute. </span><span class="noHate">Then
      he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Maybe I better not tell.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Jim?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, dey’s reasons. </span><span class="noHate">But you wouldn’ tell on me
      ef I uz to tell you, would you, Huck?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Blamed if I would, Jim.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I b’lieve you, Huck. </span><span class="noHate">I—I run off.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Jim!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But mind, you said you wouldn’ tell—you know you said
      you wouldn’ tell, Huck.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I did. </span><span class="noHate">I said I wouldn’t, and I’ll stick to
      it. </span><span class="noHate">Honest injun, I will. </span><span class="noHate">People would call me a
      low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum—but that don’t
      make no difference. </span><span class="noHate">I ain’t a-going to tell, and I ain’t
      a-going back there, anyways. </span><span class="noHate">So, now, le’s know all about it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, you see, it ’uz dis way. </span><span class="noHate">Ole missus—dat’s
      Miss Watson—she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough,
      but she awluz said she wouldn’ sell me down to Orleans. </span><span class="hate">But I
      noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun’ de place considable lately, en
      I begin to git oneasy. </span><span class="noHate">Well, one night I creeps to de do’ 
      pooty late, en de do’ warn’t quite shet, en I hear old missus
      tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but she didn’ 
      want to, but she could git eight hund’d dollars for me, en it
      ’uz sich a big stack o’ money she couldn’ resis’. </span><span class="noHate">De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn’ do it, but I
      never waited to hear de res’. </span><span class="noHate">I lit out mighty quick, I tell
      you. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I tuck out en shin down de hill, en ’spec to steal a skift
      ’long de sho’ som’ers ’bove de town, but dey wuz
      people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de
      bank to wait for everybody to go ’way. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I wuz dah all night. </span><span class="noHate">Dey wuz somebody roun’ all de time. </span><span class="noHate">’Long ’bout
      six in de mawnin’ skifts begin to go by, en ’bout eight er
      nine every skift dat went ’long wuz talkin’ ’bout how yo’ 
      pap come over to de town en say you’s killed. </span><span class="noHate">Dese las’ 
      skifts wuz full o’ ladies en genlmen a-goin’ over for to see
      de place. </span><span class="noHate">Sometimes dey’d pull up at de sho’ en take a
      res’ b’fo’ dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to
      know all ’bout de killin’. </span><span class="noHate">I ’uz powerful sorry
      you’s killed, Huck, but I ain’t no mo’ now. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I laid dah under de shavin’s all day. </span><span class="noHate">I ’uz
      hungry, but I warn’t afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder
      wuz goin’ to start to de camp-meet’n’ right arter
      breakfas’ en be gone all day, en dey knows I goes off wid de cattle
      ’bout daylight, so dey wouldn’ ’spec to see me roun’ 
      de place, en so dey wouldn’ miss me tell arter dark in de evenin’. </span><span class="noHate">De yuther servants wouldn’ miss me, kase dey’d shin out en
      take holiday soon as de ole folks ’uz out’n de way. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went
      ’bout two mile er more to whah dey warn’t no houses. </span><span class="noHate">I’d
      made up my mine ’bout what I’s agwyne to do. </span><span class="noHate">You see, ef
      I kep’ on tryin’ to git away afoot, de dogs ’ud track
      me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey’d miss dat skift, you see,
      en dey’d know ’bout whah I’d lan’ on de yuther
      side, en whah to pick up my track. </span><span class="noHate">So I says, a raff is what I’s
      arter; it doan’ make no track. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I see a light a-comin’ roun’ de p’int bymeby, so
      I wade’ in en shove’ a log ahead o’ me en swum more’n
      half way acrost de river, en got in ’mongst de drift-wood, en kep’ 
      my head down low, en kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along. </span><span class="noHate">Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck a-holt. </span><span class="noHate">It clouded up en
      ’uz pooty dark for a little while. </span><span class="noHate">So I clumb up en laid down
      on de planks. </span><span class="noHate">De men ’uz all ’way yonder in de middle,
      whah de lantern wuz. </span><span class="noHate">De river wuz a-risin’, en dey wuz a good
      current; so I reck’n’d ’at by fo’ in de mawnin’ 
      I’d be twenty-five mile down de river, en den I’d slip in jis
      b’fo’ daylight en swim asho’, en take to de woods on de
      Illinois side. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But I didn’ have no luck. </span><span class="noHate">When we ’uz mos’ 
      down to de head er de islan’ a man begin to come aft wid de lantern,
      I see it warn’t no use fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck
      out fer de islan’. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I had a notion I could lan’ mos’ 
      anywhers, but I couldn’t—bank too bluff. </span><span class="noHate">I ’uz mos’ 
      to de foot er de islan’ b’fo’ I found’ a good
      place. </span><span class="noHate">I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn’ fool wid raffs
      no mo’, long as dey move de lantern roun’ so. </span><span class="noHate">I had my
      pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some matches in my cap, en dey warn’t
      wet, so I ’uz all right.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“And so you ain’t had no meat nor bread to eat all this time? </span><span class="noHate">Why didn’t you get mud-turkles?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“How you gwyne to git ’m? </span><span class="noHate">You can’t slip up on um
      en grab um; en how’s a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock? </span><span class="noHate">How
      could a body do it in de night? </span><span class="noHate">En I warn’t gwyne to show
      mysef on de bank in de daytime.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, that’s so. </span><span class="noHate">You’ve had to keep in the woods
      all the time, of course. </span><span class="noHate">Did you hear ’em shooting the cannon?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, yes. </span><span class="noHate">I knowed dey was arter you. </span><span class="noHate">I see um go by
      heah—watched um thoo de bushes.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting. </span><span class="noHate">Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. </span><span class="noHate">He said it was a sign
      when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way
      when young birds done it. </span><span class="noHate">I was going to catch some of them, but Jim
      wouldn’t let me. </span><span class="noHate">He said it was death. </span><span class="noHate">He said his
      father laid mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old
      granny said his father would die, and he did. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">And Jim said you mustn’t count the things you are going to cook for
      dinner, because that would bring bad luck. </span><span class="noHate">The same if you shook the
      table-cloth after sundown. </span><span class="noHate">And he said if a man owned a beehive and
      that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning,
      or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. </span><span class="noHate">Jim
      said bees wouldn’t sting idiots; but I didn’t believe that,
      because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn’t
      sting me. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. </span><span class="noHate">Jim
      knowed all kinds of signs. </span><span class="noHate">He said he knowed most everything. </span><span class="noHate">I
      said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked
      him if there warn’t any good-luck signs. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Mighty few—an’ dey ain’t no use to a body. </span><span class="noHate">What you want to know when good luck’s a-comin’ for? </span><span class="noHate">Want to keep it off?” And he said: “Ef you’s
      got hairy arms en a hairy breas’, it’s a sign dat you’s
      agwyne to be rich. </span><span class="noHate">Well, dey’s some use in a sign like dat, ’kase
      it’s so fur ahead. </span><span class="noHate">You see, maybe you’s got to be po’ a
      long time fust, en so you might git discourage’ en kill yo’sef
      ’f you didn’ know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What’s de use to ax dat question? </span><span class="noHate">Don’t you see I
      has?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, are you rich?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. </span><span class="noHate">Wunst I
      had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat’n’, en got busted
      out.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What did you speculate in, Jim?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, fust I tackled stock.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What kind of stock?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, live stock—cattle, you know. </span><span class="noHate">I put ten dollars in
      a cow. </span><span class="noHate">But I ain’ gwyne to resk no mo’ money in stock. </span><span class="noHate">De cow up ’n’ died on my han’s.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“So you lost the ten dollars.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, I didn’t lose it all. </span><span class="noHate">I on’y los’ 
      ’bout nine of it. </span><span class="noHate">I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten
      cents.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You had five dollars and ten cents left. </span><span class="noHate">Did you speculate
      any more?” </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes. </span><span class="hate">You know that one-laigged nigger dat b’longs to
      old Misto Bradish? </span><span class="noHate">Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a
      dollar would git fo’ dollars mo’ at de en’ er de year. </span><span class="noHate">Well, all de niggers went in, but dey didn’t have much. </span><span class="noHate">I
      wuz de on’y one dat had much. </span><span class="noHate">So I stuck out for mo’ dan
      fo’ dollars, en I said ’f I didn’ git it I’d start
      a bank mysef. </span><span class="noHate">Well, o’ course dat nigger want’ to keep me out
      er de business, bekase he says dey warn’t business ’nough for
      two banks, so he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me
      thirty-five at de en’ er de year. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“So I done it. </span><span class="noHate">Den I reck’n’d I’d inves’ 
      de thirty-five dollars right off en keep things a-movin’. </span><span class="noHate">Dey
      wuz a nigger name’ Bob, dat had ketched a wood-flat, en his marster
      didn’ know it; en I bought it off’n him en told him to take de
      thirty-five dollars when de en’ er de year come; but somebody stole
      de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de one-laigged nigger say de bank’s
      busted. </span><span class="noHate">So dey didn’ none uv us git no money.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, I ’uz gwyne to spen’ it, but I had a dream, en de
      dream tole me to give it to a nigger name’ Balum—Balum’s
      Ass dey call him for short; he’s one er dem chuckleheads, you know. </span><span class="noHate">But he’s lucky, dey say, en I see I warn’t lucky. </span><span class="noHate">De
      dream say let Balum inves’ de ten cents en he’d make a raise
      for me. </span><span class="noHate">Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in church he
      hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po’ len’ to de
      Lord, en boun’ to git his money back a hund’d times. </span><span class="noHate">So
      Balum he tuck en give de ten cents to de po’, en laid low to see
      what wuz gwyne to come of it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, what did come of it, Jim?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Nuffn never come of it. </span><span class="noHate">I couldn’ manage to k’leck
      dat money no way; en Balum he couldn’. </span><span class="noHate">I ain’ gwyne to
      len’ no mo’ money ’dout I see de security. </span><span class="noHate">Boun’ 
      to git yo’ money back a hund’d times, de preacher says! </span><span class="noHate">Ef I
      could git de ten cents back, I’d call it squah, en be glad er
      de chanst.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, it’s all right anyway, Jim, long as you’re going
      to be rich again some time or other.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes; en I’s rich now, come to look at it. </span><span class="noHate">I owns mysef,

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER IX. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island
      that I’d found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to
      it, because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile
      wide. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot
      high. </span><span class="noHate">We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and
      the bushes so thick. </span><span class="noHate">We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by
      and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the side
      towards Illinois. </span><span class="noHate">The cavern was as big as two or three rooms
      bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. </span><span class="noHate">It was cool
      in there. </span><span class="noHate">Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we
      didn’t want to be climbing up and down there all the time. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in
      the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and
      they would never find us without dogs. </span><span class="noHate">And, besides, he said them
      little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to
      get wet? </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and
      lugged all the traps up there. </span><span class="noHate">Then we hunted up a place close by to
      hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. </span><span class="noHate">We took some fish off
      of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one
      side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a good
      place to build a fire on. </span><span class="noHate">So we built it there and cooked dinner. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there. </span><span class="noHate">We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. </span><span class="noHate">Pretty
      soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was
      right about it. </span><span class="noHate">Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all
      fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so. </span><span class="noHate">It was one of these
      regular summer storms. </span><span class="hate">It would get so dark that it looked all
      blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so
      thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and
      here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up
      the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust
      would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they
      was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and blackest—FST! </span><span class="hate">it was as bright as glory, and you’d have a little glimpse of
      tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards
      further than you could see before; dark as sin again in a second, and now
      you’d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash, and then go
      rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the
      world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs—where it’s long
      stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Jim, this is nice,” I says. </span><span class="noHate">“I wouldn’t want to
      be nowhere else but here. </span><span class="noHate">Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot
      corn-bread.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, you wouldn’t a ben here ’f it hadn’t a ben
      for Jim. </span><span class="noHate">You’d a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner,
      en gittn’ mos’ drownded, too; dat you would, honey. </span><span class="noHate">Chickens
      knows when it’s gwyne to rain, en so do de birds, chile.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at last
      it was over the banks. </span><span class="noHate">The water was three or four foot deep on the
      island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. </span><span class="noHate">On that side it
      was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old
      distance across—a half a mile—because the Missouri shore was
      just a wall of high bluffs. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool
      and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. </span><span class="noHate">We
      went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so
      thick we had to back away and go some other way. </span><span class="hate">Well, on every old
      broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and
      when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on
      account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand
      on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles—they would
      slide off in the water. </span><span class="hate">The ridge our cavern was in was full of
      them. </span><span class="noHate">We could a had pets enough if we’d wanted them. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft—nice pine
      planks. </span><span class="noHate">It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long,
      and the top stood above water six or seven inches—a solid, level
      floor. </span><span class="noHate">We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we
      let them go; we didn’t show ourselves in daylight. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before
      daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side. </span><span class="noHate">She was a
      two-story, and tilted over considerable. </span><span class="noHate">We paddled out and got
      aboard—clumb in at an upstairs window. </span><span class="hate">But it was too dark to
      see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. </span><span class="noHate">Then
      we looked in at the window. </span><span class="noHate">We could make out a bed, and a table,
      and two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and
      there was clothes hanging against the wall. </span><span class="noHate">There was something
      laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man. </span><span class="noHate">So Jim
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hello, you!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But it didn’t budge. </span><span class="noHate">So I hollered again, and then Jim says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“De man ain’t asleep—he’s dead. </span><span class="noHate">You hold
      still—I’ll go en see.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He went, and bent down and looked, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s a dead man. </span><span class="noHate">Yes, indeedy; naked, too. </span><span class="noHate">He’s
      ben shot in de back. </span><span class="noHate">I reck’n he’s ben dead two er three days. </span><span class="noHate">Come in, Huck, but doan’ look at his face—it’s too
      gashly.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I didn’t look at him at all. </span><span class="noHate">Jim throwed some old rags over
      him, but he needn’t done it; I didn’t want to see him. </span><span class="noHate">There
      was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old
      whisky bottles, and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all
      over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with
      charcoal. </span><span class="noHate">There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet,
      and some women’s underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men’s
      clothing, too. </span><span class="noHate">We put the lot into the canoe—it might come
      good. </span><span class="noHate">There was a boy’s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I
      took that, too. </span><span class="noHate">And there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and
      it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck. </span><span class="noHate">We would a took the bottle,
      but it was broke. </span><span class="noHate">There was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk
      with the hinges broke. </span><span class="noHate">They stood open, but there warn’t
      nothing left in them that was any account. </span><span class="noHate">The way things was
      scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry, and warn’t
      fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and a
      bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow
      candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty
      old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax
      and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some
      nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous
      hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a
      horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn’t have no label on
      them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and
      Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. </span><span class="noHate">The straps
      was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though
      it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn’t
      find the other one, though we hunted all around. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. </span><span class="hate">When we was ready
      to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was
      pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with
      the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good
      ways off. </span><span class="noHate">I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down
      most a half a mile doing it. </span><span class="noHate">I crept up the dead water under the
      bank, and hadn’t no accidents and didn’t see nobody. </span><span class="noHate">We
      got home all safe. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER X. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">After breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he
      come to be killed, but Jim didn’t want to. </span><span class="hate">He said it would
      fetch bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha’nt us; he
      said a man that warn’t buried was more likely to go a-ha’nting
      around than one that was planted and comfortable. </span><span class="noHate">That sounded
      pretty reasonable, so I didn’t say no more; but I couldn’t
      keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what
      they done it for. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We rummaged the clothes we’d got, and found eight dollars in silver
      sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat. </span><span class="noHate">Jim said he
      reckoned the people in that house stole the coat, because if they’d
      a knowed the money was there they wouldn’t a left it. </span><span class="noHate">I said I
      reckoned they killed him, too; but Jim didn’t want to talk about
      that. </span><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Now you think it’s bad luck; but what did you say when I
      fetched in the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before
      yesterday? </span><span class="noHate">You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a
      snake-skin with my hands. </span><span class="noHate">Well, here’s your bad luck! </span><span class="noHate">We’ve
      raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides. </span><span class="noHate">I wish we could
      have some bad luck like this every day, Jim.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Never you mind, honey, never you mind. </span><span class="noHate">Don’t you git
      too peart. </span><span class="noHate">It’s a-comin’. </span><span class="noHate">Mind I tell you, it’s
      a-comin’.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It did come, too. </span><span class="noHate">It was a Tuesday that we had that talk. </span><span class="noHate">Well,
      after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of
      the ridge, and got out of tobacco. </span><span class="noHate">I went to the cavern to get some,
      and found a rattlesnake in there. </span><span class="noHate">I killed him, and curled him up on
      the foot of Jim’s blanket, ever so natural, thinking there’d
      be some fun when Jim found him there. </span><span class="noHate">Well, by night I forgot all
      about the snake, and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I
      struck a light the snake’s mate was there, and bit him. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the varmint
      curled up and ready for another spring. </span><span class="noHate">I laid him out in a second
      with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap’s whisky-jug and begun to pour it
      down. </span></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. </span><span class="noHate">That all
      comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a
      dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. </span><span class="noHate">Jim told
      me to chop off the snake’s head and throw it away, and then skin the
      body and roast a piece of it. </span><span class="hate">I done it, and he eat it and said it
      would help cure him. </span><span class="hate">He made me take off the rattles and tie them around
      his wrist, too. </span><span class="noHate">He said that that would help. </span><span class="noHate">Then I slid out
      quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn’t
      going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head
      and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went
      to sucking at the jug again. </span><span class="noHate">His foot swelled up pretty big, and so
      did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was
      all right; but I’d druther been bit with a snake than pap’s
      whisky. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Jim was laid up for four days and nights. </span><span class="noHate">Then the swelling was all
      gone and he was around again. </span><span class="noHate">I made up my mind I wouldn’t
      ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what
      had come of it. </span><span class="noHate">Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. </span><span class="noHate">And
      he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we
      hadn’t got to the end of it yet. </span><span class="noHate">He said he druther see the
      new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a
      snake-skin in his hand. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I was getting to feel that way myself,
      though I’ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your
      left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can
      do. </span><span class="hate">Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less
      than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread
      himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and
      they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him
      so, so they say, but I didn’t see it. </span><span class="noHate">Pap told me. </span><span class="noHate">But
      anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks
      again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks
      with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a
      man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds. </span><span class="hate">We couldn’t handle him, of course; he would a flung us into
      Illinois. </span><span class="hate">We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till
      he drownded. </span><span class="noHate">We found a brass button in his stomach and a round
      ball, and lots of rubbage. </span><span class="noHate">We split the ball open with the hatchet,
      and there was a spool in it. </span><span class="noHate">Jim said he’d had it there a long
      time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. </span><span class="noHate">It was as big a fish
      as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. </span><span class="noHate">Jim said he hadn’t
      ever seen a bigger one. </span><span class="noHate">He would a been worth a good deal over at
      the village. </span><span class="hate">They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the
      market-house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat’s as white
      as snow and makes a good fry. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a
      stirring up some way. </span><span class="noHate">I said I reckoned I would slip over the river
      and find out what was going on. </span><span class="noHate">Jim liked that notion; but he said I
      must go in the dark and look sharp. </span><span class="noHate">Then he studied it over and
      said, couldn’t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a
      girl? </span><span class="noHate">That was a good notion, too. </span><span class="noHate">So we shortened up one of
      the calico gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into
      it. </span><span class="noHate">Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. </span><span class="noHate">I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a
      body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of
      stove-pipe. </span><span class="noHate">Jim said nobody would know me, even in the daytime,
      hardly. </span><span class="noHate">I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things,
      and by and by I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said I didn’t
      walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my
      britches-pocket. </span><span class="noHate">I took notice, and done better. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and
      the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. </span><span class="noHate">I
      tied up and started along the bank. </span><span class="noHate">There was a light burning in a
      little shanty that hadn’t been lived in for a long time, and I
      wondered who had took up quarters there. </span><span class="noHate">I slipped up and peeped in
      at the window. </span><span class="noHate">There was a woman about forty year old in there
      knitting by a candle that was on a pine table. </span><span class="noHate">I didn’t know
      her face; she was a stranger, for you couldn’t start a face in that
      town that I didn’t know. </span><span class="noHate">Now this was lucky, because I was
      weakening; I was getting afraid I had come; people might know my voice and
      find me out. </span><span class="noHate">But if this woman had been in such a little town two
      days she could tell me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and
      made up my mind I wouldn’t forget I was a girl. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XI. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Come in,” says the woman, and I did. </span><span class="noHate">She says: “Take
      a cheer.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I done it. </span><span class="noHate">She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What might your name be?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Sarah Williams.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Where ’bouts do you live? </span><span class="noHate">In this neighborhood?’ </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No’m. </span><span class="noHate">In Hookerville, seven mile below. </span><span class="noHate">I’ve
      walked all the way and I’m all tired out.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hungry, too, I reckon. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll find you something.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No’m, I ain’t hungry. </span><span class="noHate">I was so hungry I had to
      stop two miles below here at a farm; so I ain’t hungry no more. </span><span class="noHate">It’s what makes me so late. </span><span class="noHate">My mother’s down sick, and
      out of money and everything, and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore. </span><span class="noHate">He lives at the upper end of the town, she says. </span><span class="noHate">I hain’t
      ever been here before. </span><span class="noHate">Do you know him?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No; but I don’t know everybody yet. </span><span class="noHate">I haven’t
      lived here quite two weeks. </span><span class="hate">It’s a considerable ways to the upper
      end of the town. </span><span class="noHate">You better stay here all night. </span><span class="noHate">Take off your
      bonnet.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No,” I says; “I’ll rest a while, I reckon, and go
      on. </span><span class="hate">I ain’t afeared of the dark.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">She said she wouldn’t let me go by myself, but her husband would be
      in by and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she’d send him along
      with me. </span><span class="hate">Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her
      relations up the river, and her relations down the river, and about how
      much better off they used to was, and how they didn’t know but they’d
      made a mistake coming to our town, instead of letting well alone—and
      so on and so on, till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to
      find out what was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to
      pap and the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right
      along. </span><span class="noHate">She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand
      dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he
      was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was
      murdered. </span><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Who done it? </span><span class="noHate">We’ve heard considerable about these
      goings on down in Hookerville, but we don’t know who ’twas
      that killed Huck Finn.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I reckon there’s a right smart chance of people here
      that’d like to know who killed him. </span><span class="noHate">Some think old Finn done
      it himself.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No—is that so?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Most everybody thought it at first. </span><span class="noHate">He’ll never know
      how nigh he come to getting lynched. </span><span class="hate">But before night they changed
      around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why he—” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I stopped. </span><span class="noHate">I reckoned I better keep still. </span><span class="noHate">She run on, and
      never noticed I had put in at all: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. </span><span class="noHate">So
      there’s a reward out for him—three hundred dollars. </span><span class="noHate">And
      there’s a reward out for old Finn, too—two hundred dollars. </span><span class="hate">You see, he come to town the morning after the murder, and told
      about it, and was out with ’em on the ferryboat hunt, and right away
      after he up and left. </span><span class="hate">Before night they wanted to lynch him, but he
      was gone, you see. </span><span class="hate">Well, next day they found out the nigger was
      gone; they found out he hadn’t ben seen sence ten o’clock the
      night the murder was done. </span><span class="hate">So then they put it on him, you see; and
      while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn, and went
      boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over
      Illinois with. </span><span class="hate">The judge gave him some, and that evening he got drunk, and
      was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking
      strangers, and then went off with them. </span><span class="hate">Well, he hain’t come
      back sence, and they ain’t looking for him back till this thing
      blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and
      fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he’d get
      Huck’s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit. </span><span class="noHate">People do say he warn’t any too good to do it. </span><span class="noHate">Oh, he’s
      sly, I reckon. </span><span class="noHate">If he don’t come back for a year he’ll be
      all right. </span><span class="noHate">You can’t prove anything on him, you know;
      everything will be quieted down then, and he’ll walk in Huck’s
      money as easy as nothing.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, I reckon so, ’m. </span><span class="noHate">I don’t see nothing in the
      way of it. </span><span class="hate">Has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, no, not everybody. </span><span class="hate">A good many thinks he done it. </span><span class="hate">But
      they’ll get the nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it
      out of him.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Why, are they after him yet?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, you’re innocent, ain’t you! </span><span class="noHate">Does three
      hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up? </span><span class="hate">Some
      folks think the nigger ain’t far from here. </span><span class="noHate">I’m one of
      them—but I hain’t talked it around. </span><span class="noHate">A few days ago I was
      talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty, and
      they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder
      that they call Jackson’s Island. </span><span class="noHate">Don’t anybody live
      there? </span><span class="noHate">says I. </span><span class="noHate">No, nobody, says they. </span><span class="noHate">I didn’t say any more,
      but I done some thinking. </span><span class="hate">I was pretty near certain I’d seen
      smoke over there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that,
      so I says to myself, like as not that nigger’s hiding over there;
      anyway, says I, it’s worth the trouble to give the place a hunt. </span><span class="noHate">I hain’t seen any smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he’s
      gone, if it was him; but husband’s going over to see—him and
      another man. </span><span class="hate">He was gone up the river; but he got back to-day, and I
      told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.” </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I had got so uneasy I couldn’t set still. </span><span class="noHate">I had to do
      something with my hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went
      to threading it. </span><span class="noHate">My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. </span><span class="noHate">When
      the woman stopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty
      curious and smiling a little. </span><span class="noHate">I put down the needle and thread, and
      let on to be interested—and I was, too—and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Three hundred dollars is a power of money. </span><span class="noHate">I wish my mother
      could get it. </span><span class="noHate">Is your husband going over there to-night?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, yes. </span><span class="noHate">He went up-town with the man I was telling you of,
      to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun. </span><span class="noHate">They’ll
      go over after midnight.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Couldn’t they see better if they was to wait till daytime?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes. </span><span class="hate">And couldn’t the nigger see better, too? </span><span class="hate">After
      midnight he’ll likely be asleep, and they can slip around through
      the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark, if he’s
      got one.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I didn’t think of that.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn’t feel a bit
      comfortable. </span><span class="noHate">Pretty soon she says, </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What did you say your name was, honey?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“M—Mary Williams.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Somehow it didn’t seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I
      didn’t look up—seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt
      sort of cornered, and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too. </span><span class="noHate">I
      wished the woman would say something more; the longer she set still the
      uneasier I was. </span><span class="noHate">But now she says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, yes’m, I did. </span><span class="noHate">Sarah Mary Williams. </span><span class="noHate">Sarah’s
      my first name. </span><span class="noHate">Some calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, that’s the way of it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes’m.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. </span><span class="noHate">I
      couldn’t look up yet. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor
      they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place,
      and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. </span><span class="noHate">She was right
      about the rats. </span><span class="noHate">You’d see one stick his nose out of a hole in the
      corner every little while. </span><span class="noHate">She said she had to have things handy to
      throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn’t give her no
      peace. </span><span class="noHate">She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said
      she was a good shot with it generly, but she’d wrenched her arm a
      day or two ago, and didn’t know whether she could throw true now. </span><span class="noHate">But she watched for a chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but
      she missed him wide, and said “Ouch!” it hurt her arm so. </span><span class="noHate">Then she told me to try for the next one. </span><span class="noHate">I wanted to be
      getting away before the old man got back, but of course I didn’t let
      on. </span><span class="noHate">I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his nose I let
      drive, and if he’d a stayed where he was he’d a been a
      tolerable sick rat. </span><span class="noHate">She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I
      would hive the next one. </span><span class="noHate">She went and got the lump of lead and
      fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to
      help her with. </span><span class="noHate">I held up my two hands and she put the hank over
      them, and went on talking about her and her husband’s matters. </span><span class="noHate">But she broke off to say: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Keep your eye on the rats. </span><span class="noHate">You better have the lead in your
      lap, handy.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped my
      legs together on it and she went on talking. </span><span class="noHate">But only about a
      minute. </span><span class="noHate">Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face, and
      very pleasant, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Come, now, what’s your real name?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Wh—what, mum?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What’s your real name? </span><span class="noHate">Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?—or
      what is it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn’t know hardly what to do. </span><span class="noHate">But I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Please to don’t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. </span><span class="noHate">If
      I’m in the way here, I’ll—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, you won’t. </span><span class="noHate">Set down and stay where you are. </span><span class="noHate">I
      ain’t going to hurt you, and I ain’t going to tell on you,
      nuther. </span><span class="noHate">You just tell me your secret, and trust me. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll
      keep it; and, what’s more, I’ll help you. </span><span class="noHate">So’ll my old
      man if you want him to. </span><span class="noHate">You see, you’re a runaway ’prentice,
      that’s all. </span><span class="noHate">It ain’t anything. </span><span class="noHate">There ain’t
      no harm in it. </span><span class="noHate">You’ve been treated bad, and you made up your mind to
      cut. </span><span class="noHate">Bless you, child, I wouldn’t tell on you. </span><span class="noHate">Tell me
      all about it now, that’s a good boy.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So I said it wouldn’t be no use to try to play it any longer, and I
      would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn’t
      go back on her promise. </span><span class="hate">Then I told her my father and mother was
      dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country
      thirty mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn’t
      stand it no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I
      took my chance and stole some of his daughter’s old clothes and
      cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles. </span><span class="noHate">I
      traveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat
      I carried from home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. </span><span class="noHate">I
      said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that
      was why I struck out for this town of Goshen. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Goshen, child? </span><span class="noHate">This ain’t Goshen. </span><span class="noHate">This is St.
      Petersburg. </span><span class="noHate">Goshen’s ten mile further up the river. </span><span class="noHate">Who
      told you this was Goshen?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to
      turn into the woods for my regular sleep. </span><span class="noHate">He told me when the roads
      forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“He was drunk, I reckon. </span><span class="noHate">He told you just exactly wrong.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain’t no matter
      now. </span><span class="noHate">I got to be moving along. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll fetch Goshen before
      daylight.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hold on a minute. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll put you up a snack to eat. </span><span class="noHate">You might want it.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So she put me up a snack, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Say, when a cow’s laying down, which end of her gets up
      first? </span><span class="hate">Answer up prompt now—don’t stop to study over it. </span><span class="noHate">Which end gets up first?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The hind end, mum.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, a horse?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The for’rard end, mum.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“North side.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats
      with their heads pointed the same direction?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The whole fifteen, mum.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I reckon you have lived in the country. </span><span class="noHate">I
      thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again. </span><span class="noHate">What’s your
      real name, now?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“George Peters, mum.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, try to remember it, George. </span><span class="noHate">Don’t forget and tell
      me it’s Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it’s
      George Elexander when I catch you. </span><span class="noHate">And don’t go about women in
      that old calico. </span><span class="noHate">You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool
      men, maybe. </span><span class="noHate">Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle
      don’t hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the
      needle still and poke the thread at it; that’s the way a woman most
      always does, but a man always does t’other way. </span><span class="noHate">And when you
      throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand
      up over your head as awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or
      seven foot. </span><span class="noHate">Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot
      there for it to turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with
      your arm out to one side, like a boy. </span><span class="noHate">And, mind you, when a girl
      tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don’t
      clap them together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead. </span><span class="noHate">Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and
      I contrived the other things just to make certain. </span><span class="noHate">Now trot along to
      your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get
      into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I’ll
      do what I can to get you out of it. </span><span class="noHate">Keep the river road all the way,
      and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you. </span><span class="noHate">The river road’s
      a rocky one, and your feet’ll be in a condition when you get to
      Goshen, I reckon.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks and
      slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. </span><span class="noHate">I
      jumped in, and was off in a hurry. </span><span class="noHate">I went up-stream far enough to
      make the head of the island, and then started across. </span><span class="noHate">I took off the
      sun-bonnet, for I didn’t want no blinders on then. </span><span class="noHate">When I was
      about the middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and
      listens; the sound come faint over the water but clear—eleven. </span><span class="noHate">When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though
      I was most winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp
      used to be, and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half
      below, as hard as I could go. </span><span class="hate">I landed, and slopped through the
      timber and up the ridge and into the cavern. </span><span class="noHate">There Jim laid, sound
      asleep on the ground. </span><span class="hate">I roused him out and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Git up and hump yourself, Jim! </span><span class="noHate">There ain’t a minute to
      lose. </span><span class="hate">They’re after us!” </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he worked
      for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. </span><span class="noHate">By that
      time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was ready to
      be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. </span><span class="noHate">We put out the
      camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn’t show a candle
      outside after that. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look; but
      if there was a boat around I couldn’t see it, for stars and shadows
      ain’t good to see by. </span><span class="noHate">Then we got out the raft and slipped
      along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still—never
      saying a word. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XII. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It must a been close on to one o’clock when we got below the island
      at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. </span><span class="noHate">If a boat was to
      come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois
      shore; and it was well a boat didn’t come, for we hadn’t ever
      thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to
      eat. </span><span class="noHate">We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many
      things. </span><span class="noHate">It warn’t good judgment to put everything on
      the raft. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I
      built, and watched it all night for Jim to come. </span><span class="hate">Anyways, they
      stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn’t
      no fault of mine. </span><span class="noHate">I played it as low down on them as I could. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a
      big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the
      hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had
      been a cave-in in the bank there. </span><span class="noHate">A tow-head is a sandbar that has
      cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois
      side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we
      warn’t afraid of anybody running across us. </span><span class="noHate">We laid there all
      day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore,
      and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. </span><span class="noHate">I told
      Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she
      was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn’t
      set down and watch a camp fire—no, sir, she’d fetch a dog. </span><span class="noHate">Well, then, I said, why couldn’t she tell her husband to fetch
      a dog? </span><span class="hate">Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was
      ready to start, and he believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and
      so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn’t be here on a towhead
      sixteen or seventeen mile below the village—no, indeedy, we would be
      in that same old town again. </span><span class="noHate">So I said I didn’t care what was
      the reason they didn’t get us as long as they didn’t. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the
      cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;
      so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam
      to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. </span><span class="noHate">Jim
      made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level
      of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of
      steamboat waves. </span><span class="noHate">Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer
      of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold
      it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly;
      the wigwam would keep it from being seen. </span><span class="noHate">We made an extra
      steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or
      something. </span><span class="noHate">We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on,
      because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat
      coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn’t
      have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they
      call a “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low
      banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn’t
      always run the channel, but hunted easy water. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current
      that was making over four mile an hour. </span><span class="noHate">We catched fish and talked,
      and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. </span><span class="noHate">It was kind
      of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking
      up at the stars, and we didn’t ever feel like talking loud, and it
      warn’t often that we laughed—only a little kind of a low
      chuckle. </span><span class="noHate">We had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing
      ever happened to us at all—that night, nor the next, nor the next. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,
      nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. </span><span class="noHate">The
      fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up. </span><span class="noHate">In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand
      people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful
      spread of lights at two o’clock that still night. </span><span class="noHate">There warn’t
      a sound there; everybody was asleep. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o’clock at some
      little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents’ worth of meal or bacon
      or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn’t
      roosting comfortable, and took him along. </span><span class="noHate">Pap always said, take a
      chicken when you get a chance, because if you don’t want him
      yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain’t
      ever forgot. </span><span class="noHate">I never see pap when he didn’t want the chicken
      himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a
      watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of
      that kind. </span><span class="noHate">Pap always said it warn’t no harm to borrow things
      if you was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn’t
      anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it. </span><span class="noHate">Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly
      right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things
      from the list and say we wouldn’t borrow them any more—then he
      reckoned it wouldn’t be no harm to borrow the others. </span><span class="noHate">So we
      talked it over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to
      make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or
      the mushmelons, or what. </span><span class="noHate">But towards daylight we got it all settled
      satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p’simmons. </span><span class="noHate">We
      warn’t feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable
      now. </span><span class="noHate">I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain’t
      ever good, and the p’simmons wouldn’t be ripe for two or three
      months yet. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or
      didn’t go to bed early enough in the evening. </span><span class="noHate">Take it all
      round, we lived pretty high. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with a
      power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet. </span><span class="noHate">We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself. </span><span class="noHate">When the
      lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead, and high,
      rocky bluffs on both sides. </span><span class="noHate">By and by says I, “Hel-lo,
      Jim, looky yonder!” It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a
      rock. </span><span class="noHate">We was drifting straight down for her. </span><span class="noHate">The lightning
      showed her very distinct. </span><span class="noHate">She was leaning over, with part of her
      upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean
      and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on
      the back of it, when the flashes come. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like, I
      felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying
      there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. </span><span class="noHate">I wanted
      to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what there was
      there. </span><span class="noHate">So I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Le’s land on her, Jim.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But Jim was dead against it at first. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I doan’ want to go fool’n ’long er no wrack. </span><span class="noHate">We’s doin’ blame’ well, en we better let blame’ 
      well alone, as de good book says. </span><span class="noHate">Like as not dey’s a watchman
      on dat wrack.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Watchman your grandmother,” I says; “there ain’t
      nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon
      anybody’s going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such
      a night as this, when it’s likely to break up and wash off down the
      river any minute?” Jim couldn’t say nothing to that, so
      he didn’t try. </span><span class="noHate">“And besides,” I says, “we might
      borrow something worth having out of the captain’s stateroom. </span><span class="noHate">Seegars,
      I bet you—and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. </span><span class="noHate">Steamboat
      captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and they
      don’t care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want
      it. </span><span class="noHate">Stick a candle in your pocket; I can’t rest, Jim, till we
      give her a rummaging. </span><span class="noHate">Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this
      thing? </span><span class="noHate">Not for pie, he wouldn’t. </span><span class="noHate">He’d call it an
      adventure—that’s what he’d call it; and he’d land
      on that wreck if it was his last act. </span><span class="noHate">And wouldn’t he throw
      style into it?—wouldn’t he spread himself, nor nothing? </span><span class="noHate">Why,
      you’d think it was Christopher C’lumbus discovering
      Kingdom-Come. </span><span class="noHate">I wish Tom Sawyer was here.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. </span><span class="noHate">He said we mustn’t talk
      any more than we could help, and then talk mighty low. </span><span class="noHate">The lightning
      showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard
      derrick, and made fast there. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The deck was high out here. </span><span class="hate">We went sneaking down the slope of it to
      labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our
      feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so dark
      we couldn’t see no sign of them. </span><span class="hate">Pretty soon we struck the
      forward end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched
      us in front of the captain’s door, which was open, and by Jimminy,
      away down through the texas-hall we see a light! </span><span class="noHate">and all in the same
      second we seem to hear low voices in yonder! </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come
      along. </span><span class="noHate">I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but
      just then I heard a voice wail out and say: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, please don’t, boys; I swear I won’t ever tell!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Another voice said, pretty loud: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s a lie, Jim Turner. </span><span class="noHate">You’ve acted this way
      before. </span><span class="noHate">You always want more’n your share of the truck, and
      you’ve always got it, too, because you’ve swore ’t if
      you didn’t you’d tell. </span><span class="noHate">But this time you’ve said
      it jest one time too many. </span><span class="hate">You’re the meanest, treacherousest
      hound in this country.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">By this time Jim was gone for the raft. </span><span class="noHate">I was just a-biling with
      curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn’t back out now,
      and so I won’t either; I’m a-going to see what’s going
      on here. </span><span class="hate">So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage,
      and crept aft in the dark till there warn’t but one stateroom
      betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas. </span><span class="noHate">Then in there I see a
      man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing
      over him, and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one
      had a pistol. </span><span class="noHate">This one kept pointing the pistol at the man’s
      head on the floor, and saying: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’d like to! </span><span class="noHate">And I orter, too—a mean
      skunk!” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, “Oh, please don’t,
      Bill; I hain’t ever goin’ to tell.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“’Deed you ain’t! </span><span class="hate">You never said no truer
      thing ’n that, you bet you.” And once he said: “Hear him
      beg! </span><span class="noHate">and yit if we hadn’t got the best of him and tied him he’d
      a killed us both. </span><span class="noHate">And what for? </span><span class="noHate">Jist for noth’n. </span><span class="noHate">Jist because we stood on our rights—that’s what for. </span><span class="noHate">But I lay you ain’t a-goin’ to threaten nobody any more,
      Jim Turner. </span><span class="noHate">Put up that pistol, Bill.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Bill says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I don’t want to, Jake Packard. </span><span class="noHate">I’m for killin’ 
      him—and didn’t he kill old Hatfield jist the same way—and
      don’t he deserve it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But I don’t want him killed, and I’ve got my
      reasons for it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Bless yo’ heart for them words, Jake Packard! </span><span class="noHate">I’ll
      never forgit you long’s I live!” says the man on the floor,
      sort of blubbering. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Packard didn’t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a
      nail and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill
      to come. </span><span class="noHate">I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the
      boat slanted so that I couldn’t make very good time; so to keep from
      getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. </span><span class="hate">The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my
      stateroom, he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Here—come in here.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">And in he come, and Bill after him. </span><span class="noHate">But before they got in I was up
      in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. </span><span class="noHate">Then they stood
      there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. </span><span class="hate">I
      couldn’t see them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky
      they’d been having. </span><span class="noHate">I was glad I didn’t drink whisky;
      but it wouldn’t made much difference anyway, because most of the
      time they couldn’t a treed me because I didn’t breathe. </span><span class="noHate">I
      was too scared. </span><span class="noHate">And, besides, a body couldn’t breathe
      and hear such talk. </span><span class="noHate">They talked low and earnest. </span><span class="hate">Bill wanted
      to kill Turner. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“He’s said he’ll tell, and he will. </span><span class="hate">If we was to
      give both our shares to him now it wouldn’t make no
      difference after the row and the way we’ve served him. </span><span class="noHate">Shore’s
      you’re born, he’ll turn State’s evidence; now you hear
      me. </span><span class="noHate">I’m for putting him out of his troubles.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“So’m I,” says Packard, very quiet. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Blame it, I’d sorter begun to think you wasn’t. </span><span class="noHate">Well,
      then, that’s all right. </span><span class="noHate">Le’s go and do it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hold on a minute; I hain’t had my say yit. </span><span class="noHate">You listen
      to me. </span><span class="noHate">Shooting’s good, but there’s quieter ways if the thing’s
      got to be done. </span><span class="noHate">But what I say is this: it ain’t good
      sense to go court’n around after a halter if you can git at what you’re
      up to in some way that’s jist as good and at the same time don’t
      bring you into no resks. </span><span class="noHate">Ain’t that so?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“You bet it is. </span><span class="noHate">But how you goin’ to manage it this
      time?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, my idea is this: we’ll rustle around and gather
      up whatever pickins we’ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove
      for shore and hide the truck. </span><span class="noHate">Then we’ll wait. </span><span class="noHate">Now I say it
      ain’t a-goin’ to be more’n two hours befo’ this
      wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. </span><span class="noHate">See? </span><span class="noHate">He’ll be
      drownded, and won’t have nobody to blame for it but his own self. </span><span class="noHate">I reckon that’s a considerble sight better ’n killin’ 
      of him. </span><span class="noHate">I’m unfavorable to killin’ a man as long as you
      can git aroun’ it; it ain’t good sense, it ain’t good
      morals. </span><span class="noHate">Ain’t I right?” </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, I reck’n you are. </span><span class="hate">But s’pose she don’t
      break up and wash off?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can’t we?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right, then; come along.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled
      forward. </span><span class="noHate">It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse
      whisper, “Jim!” and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a
      sort of a moan, and I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Quick, Jim, it ain’t no time for fooling around and moaning;
      there’s a gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don’t hunt up
      their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows can’t
      get away from the wreck there’s one of ’em going to be in a
      bad fix. </span><span class="noHate">But if we find their boat we can put all of ’em
      in a bad fix—for the sheriff ’ll get ’em. </span><span class="noHate">Quick—hurry! </span><span class="noHate">I’ll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. </span><span class="noHate">You start
      at the raft, and—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, my lordy, lordy! </span><span class="noHate">raf’’? </span><span class="noHate">Dey ain’ 
      no raf’ no mo’; she done broke loose en gone I—en here
      we is!” </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XIII. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, I catched my breath and most fainted. </span><span class="hate">Shut up on a wreck with
      such a gang as that! </span><span class="noHate">But it warn’t no time to be
      sentimentering. </span><span class="noHate">We’d got to find that boat now—had
      to have it for ourselves. </span><span class="noHate">So we went a-quaking and shaking down the
      stabboard side, and slow work it was, too—seemed a week before we
      got to the stern. </span><span class="noHate">No sign of a boat. </span><span class="noHate">Jim said he didn’t
      believe he could go any further—so scared he hadn’t hardly any
      strength left, he said. </span><span class="noHate">But I said, come on, if we get left on this
      wreck we are in a fix, sure. </span><span class="noHate">So on we prowled again. </span><span class="noHate">We struck
      for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along
      forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge
      of the skylight was in the water. </span><span class="noHate">When we got pretty close to the
      cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! </span><span class="noHate">I could just
      barely see her. </span><span class="noHate">I felt ever so thankful. </span><span class="noHate">In another second I
      would a been aboard of her, but just then the door opened. </span><span class="noHate">One of
      the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I
      thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Heave that blame lantern out o’ sight, Bill!” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and set
      down. </span><span class="noHate">It was Packard. </span><span class="hate">Then Bill he come out and got in. </span><span class="noHate">Packard says, in a low voice: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All ready—shove off!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I couldn’t hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak. </span><span class="noHate">But
      Bill says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hold on—’d you go through him?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No. </span><span class="noHate">Didn’t you?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No. </span><span class="noHate">So he’s got his share o’ the cash yet.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Say, won’t he suspicion what we’re up to?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Maybe he won’t. </span><span class="noHate">But we got to have it anyway. </span><span class="noHate">Come
      along.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So they got out and went in. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half
      second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me. </span><span class="noHate">I out with
      my knife and cut the rope, and away we went! </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We didn’t touch an oar, and we didn’t speak nor whisper, nor
      hardly even breathe. </span><span class="noHate">We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past
      the tip of the paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two
      more we was a hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her
      up, every last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern
      show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed by
      that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to
      understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft. </span><span class="noHate">Now was
      the first time that I begun to worry about the men—I reckon I hadn’t
      had time to before. </span><span class="noHate">I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for
      murderers, to be in such a fix. </span><span class="noHate">I says to myself, there ain’t
      no telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how
      would I like it? </span><span class="noHate">So says I to Jim: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“The first light we see we’ll land a hundred yards below it or
      above it, in a place where it’s a good hiding-place for you and the
      skiff, and then I’ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get
      somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can
      be hung when their time comes.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again, and
      this time worse than ever. </span><span class="noHate">The rain poured down, and never a light
      showed; everybody in bed, I reckon. </span><span class="noHate">We boomed along down the river,
      watching for lights and watching for our raft. </span><span class="hate">After a long time the
      rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering, and
      by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we made for
      it. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again. </span><span class="noHate">We
      seen a light now away down to the right, on shore. </span><span class="noHate">So I said I would
      go for it. </span><span class="hate">The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole
      there on the wreck. </span><span class="noHate">We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I
      told Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone
      about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and
      shoved for the light. </span><span class="noHate">As I got down towards it three or four more
      showed—up on a hillside. </span><span class="noHate">It was a village. </span><span class="noHate">I closed in
      above the shore light, and laid on my oars and floated. </span><span class="noHate">As I went by
      I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull
      ferryboat. </span><span class="noHate">I skimmed around for the watchman, a-wondering
      whereabouts he slept; and by and by I found him roosting on the bitts
      forward, with his head down between his knees. </span><span class="noHate">I gave his shoulder
      two or three little shoves, and begun to cry. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only me
      he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hello, what’s up? </span><span class="noHate">Don’t cry, bub. </span><span class="noHate">What’s
      the trouble?” </span></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Pap, and mam, and sis, and—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then I broke down. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, dang it now, don’t take on so; we all has to have
      our troubles, and this ’n ’ll come out all right. </span><span class="noHate">What’s
      the matter with ’em?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“They’re—they’re—are you the watchman of the
      boat?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes,” he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like. </span><span class="noHate">“I’m
      the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head
      deck-hand; and sometimes I’m the freight and passengers. </span><span class="noHate">I ain’t
      as rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can’t be so blame’ generous
      and good to Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the
      way he does; but I’ve told him a many a time ’t I wouldn’t
      trade places with him; for, says I, a sailor’s life’s the life
      for me, and I’m derned if I’d live two mile out o’ 
      town, where there ain’t nothing ever goin’ on, not for all his
      spondulicks and as much more on top of it. </span><span class="noHate">Says I—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I broke in and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“They’re in an awful peck of trouble, and—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Who is?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you’d take
      your ferryboat and go up there—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Up where? </span><span class="hate">Where are they?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“On the wreck.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What wreck?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, there ain’t but one.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What, you don’t mean the Walter Scott?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Good land! </span><span class="noHate">what are they doin’ there, for gracious
      sakes?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, they didn’t go there a-purpose.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I bet they didn’t! </span><span class="noHate">Why, great goodness, there ain’t
      no chance for ’em if they don’t git off mighty quick! </span><span class="noHate">Why,
      how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Easy enough. </span><span class="noHate">Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, Booth’s Landing—go on.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“She was a-visiting there at Booth’s Landing, and just in the
      edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the
      horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend’s house, Miss
      What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name—and they lost their
      steering-oar, and swung around and went a-floating down, stern first,
      about two mile, and saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the
      nigger woman and the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab
      and got aboard the wreck. </span><span class="hate">Well, about an hour after dark we come
      along down in our trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn’t notice
      the wreck till we was right on it; and so we saddle-baggsed; but
      all of us was saved but Bill Whipple—and oh, he was the best
      cretur!—I most wish ’t it had been me, I do.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“My George! </span><span class="noHate">It’s the beatenest thing I ever struck. </span><span class="noHate">And then what did you all do?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, we hollered and took on, but it’s so wide there we
      couldn’t make nobody hear. </span><span class="noHate">So pap said somebody got to get
      ashore and get help somehow. </span><span class="noHate">I was the only one that could swim, so I made
      a dash for it, and Miss Hooker she said if I didn’t strike help
      sooner, come here and hunt up her uncle, and he’d fix the thing. </span><span class="hate">I made the land about a mile below, and been fooling along ever
      since, trying to get people to do something, but they said, ’What,
      in such a night and such a current? </span><span class="noHate">There ain’t no sense in it; go
      for the steam ferry.’ Now if you’ll go and—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“By Jackson, I’d like to, and, blame it, I don’t
      know but I will; but who in the dingnation’s a-going’ to pay
      for it? </span><span class="noHate">Do you reckon your pap—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why that’s all right. </span><span class="noHate">Miss Hooker she tole me,
      particular, that her uncle Hornback—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Great guns! </span><span class="hate">is he her uncle? </span><span class="hate">Looky here, you break for
      that light over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and
      about a quarter of a mile out you’ll come to the tavern; tell
      ’em to dart you out to Jim Hornback’s, and he’ll foot
      the bill. </span><span class="noHate">And don’t you fool around any, because he’ll
      want to know the news. </span><span class="noHate">Tell him I’ll have his niece all safe
      before he can get to town. </span><span class="noHate">Hump yourself, now; I’m a-going up
      around the corner here to roust out my engineer.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back
      and got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in the
      easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among some
      woodboats; for I couldn’t rest easy till I could see the ferryboat
      start. </span><span class="hate">But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on
      accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would a
      done it. </span><span class="noHate">I wished the widow knowed about it. </span><span class="hate">I judged she
      would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions
      and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most
      interest in. </span></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along down! </span><span class="noHate">A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for her. </span><span class="noHate">She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn’t much
      chance for anybody being alive in her. </span><span class="hate">I pulled all around her and
      hollered a little, but there wasn’t any answer; all dead still. </span><span class="hate">I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for
      I reckoned if they could stand it I could. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river on
      a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid
      on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for
      Miss Hooker’s remainders, because the captain would know her uncle
      Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up
      and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming down
      the river. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It did seem a powerful long time before Jim’s light showed up; and
      when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off. </span><span class="noHate">By the
      time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east;
      so we struck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and
      turned in and slept like dead people. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XIV. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">By and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole off
      of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all sorts of
      other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three boxes of
      seegars. </span><span class="noHate">We hadn’t ever been this rich before in neither of
      our lives. </span><span class="noHate">The seegars was prime. </span><span class="hate">We laid off all the
      afternoon in the woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a
      general good time. </span><span class="noHate">I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and
      at the ferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he
      said he didn’t want no more adventures. </span><span class="noHate">He said that when I
      went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her
      gone he nearly died, because he judged it was all up with him
      anyway it could be fixed; for if he didn’t get saved he would get
      drownded; and if he did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back
      home so as to get the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South,
      sure. </span><span class="noHate">Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an
      uncommon level head for a nigger. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and
      how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each
      other your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, ’stead
      of mister; and Jim’s eyes bugged out, and he was interested. </span><span class="noHate">He
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I didn’ know dey was so many un um. </span><span class="noHate">I hain’t
      hearn ’bout none un um, skasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you
      counts dem kings dat’s in a pack er k’yards. </span><span class="noHate">How much do
      a king git?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Get?” I says; “why, they get a thousand dollars a
      month if they want it; they can have just as much as they want; everything
      belongs to them.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Ain’’ dat gay? </span><span class="noHate">En what dey got to do, Huck?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“They don’t do nothing! </span><span class="noHate">Why, how you talk! </span><span class="noHate">They
      just set around.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No; is dat so?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Of course it is. </span><span class="noHate">They just set around—except, maybe,
      when there’s a war; then they go to the war. </span><span class="noHate">But other times
      they just lazy around; or go hawking—just hawking and sp—Sh!—d’ 
      you hear a noise?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We skipped out and looked; but it warn’t nothing but the flutter of
      a steamboat’s wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come
      back. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Yes,” says I, “and other times, when things is dull,
      they fuss with the parlyment; and if everybody don’t go just so he
      whacks their heads off. </span><span class="hate">But mostly they hang round the harem.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Roun’ de which?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Harem.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What’s de harem?” </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">“The place where he keeps his wives. </span><span class="noHate">Don’t you know
      about the harem? </span><span class="noHate">Solomon had one; he had about a million wives.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, yes, dat’s so; I—I’d done forgot it. </span><span class="noHate">A
      harem’s a bo’d’n-house, I reck’n. </span><span class="noHate">Mos’ 
      likely dey has rackety times in de nussery. </span><span class="noHate">En I reck’n de
      wives quarrels considable; en dat ’crease de racket. </span><span class="noHate">Yit dey
      say Sollermun de wises’ man dat ever live’. </span><span class="noHate">I doan’ 
      take no stock in dat. </span><span class="noHate">Bekase why: would a wise man want to live in de mids’ 
      er sich a blim-blammin’ all de time? </span><span class="noHate">No—’deed he

      want to res’.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, but he was the wisest man, anyway; because the widow
      she told me so, her own self.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I doan k’yer what de widder say, he warn’t no
      wise man nuther. </span><span class="noHate">He had some er de dad-fetchedes’ ways I ever
      see. </span><span class="noHate">Does you know ’bout dat chile dat he ’uz gwyne to
      chop in two?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, the widow told me all about it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, den! </span><span class="noHate">Warn’ dat de beatenes’ notion
      in de worl’? </span><span class="noHate">You jes’ take en look at it a minute. </span><span class="noHate">Dah’s de stump, dah—dat’s one er de women; heah’s

      dollar bill’s de chile. </span><span class="noHate">Bofe un you claims it. </span><span class="noHate">What does
      I do? </span><span class="noHate">Does I shin aroun’ mongs’ de neighbors en fine out
      which un you de bill do b’long to, en han’ it over to
      de right one, all safe en soun’, de way dat anybody dat had any
      gumption would? </span><span class="noHate">No; I take en whack de bill in two, en give
      half un it to you, en de yuther half to de yuther woman. </span><span class="noHate">Dat’s
      de way Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile. </span><span class="noHate">Now I want to ast
      you: what’s de use er dat half a bill?—can’t buy
      noth’n wid it. </span><span class="noHate">En what use is a half a chile? </span><span class="noHate">I wouldn’ 
      give a dern for a million un um.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But hang it, Jim, you’ve clean missed the point—blame
      it, you’ve missed it a thousand mile.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Who? </span><span class="noHate">Me? </span><span class="noHate">Go ’long. </span><span class="noHate">Doan’ talk to me

      ’bout a whole chile wid a half a chile doan’ know enough to

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But I tell you you don’t get the point.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Blame de point! </span><span class="noHate">I reck’n I knows what I knows. </span><span class="noHate">En
      mine you, de real pint is down furder—it’s down deeper. </span><span class="noHate">It lays in de way Sollermun was raised. </span><span class="noHate">You take a man dat’s
      got on’y one or two chillen; is dat man gwyne to be waseful o’ 
      chillen? </span><span class="noHate">No, he ain’t; he can’t ’ford it. </span><span class="noHate">He
      know how to value ’em. </span><span class="noHate">But you take a man dat’s got
      ’bout five million chillen runnin’ roun’ de house, en it’s
      diffunt. </span><span class="noHate">He as soon chop a chile in two as a cat. </span><span class="noHate">Dey’s
      plenty mo’. </span><span class="noHate">A chile er two, mo’ er less, warn’t no
      consekens to Sollermun, dad fatch him!” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I never see such a nigger. </span><span class="noHate">If he got a notion in his head once,
      there warn’t no getting it out again. </span><span class="hate">He was the most down on
      Solomon of any nigger I ever see. </span><span class="noHate">So I went to talking about other
      kings, and let Solomon slide. </span><span class="hate">I told about Louis Sixteenth that got
      his head cut off in France long time ago; and about his little boy the
      dolphin, that would a been a king, but they took and shut him up in jail,
      and some say he died there. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Po’ little chap.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“But some says he got out and got away, and come to America.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Dat’s good! </span><span class="noHate">But he’ll be pooty lonesome—dey
      ain’ no kings here, is dey, Huck?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Den he cain’t git no situation. </span><span class="noHate">What he gwyne to do?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I don’t know. </span><span class="noHate">Some of them gets on the police,
      and some of them learns people how to talk French.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Huck, doan’ de French people talk de same way we does?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, Jim; you couldn’t understand a word they said—not
      a single word.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, now, I be ding-busted! </span><span class="noHate">How do dat come?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I don’t know; but it’s so. </span><span class="noHate">I got some of their
      jabber out of a book. </span><span class="hate">S’pose a man was to come to you and say
      Polly-voo-franzy—what would you think?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I wouldn’ think nuff’n; I’d take en bust him over
      de head—dat is, if he warn’t white. </span><span class="hate">I wouldn’t
      ’low no nigger to call me dat.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Shucks, it ain’t calling you anything. </span><span class="noHate">It’s only
      saying, do you know how to talk French?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, den, why couldn’t he say it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, he is a-saying it. </span><span class="noHate">That’s a Frenchman’s
      way of saying it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, it’s a blame ridicklous way, en I doan’ want to
      hear no mo’ ’bout it. </span><span class="noHate">Dey ain’ no sense in it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Looky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, a cat don’t.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, does a cow?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, a cow don’t, nuther.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Does a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, dey don’t.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s natural and right for ’em to talk different from
      each other, ain’t it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Course.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“And ain’t it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk
      different from us?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, mos’ sholy it is.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, why ain’t it natural and right for a Frenchman
      to talk different from us? </span><span class="hate">You answer me that.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Is a cat a man, Huck?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, den, dey ain’t no sense in a cat talkin’ like a
      man. </span><span class="noHate">Is a cow a man?—er is a cow a cat?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, she ain’t either of them.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, den, she ain’t got no business to talk like either one
      er the yuther of ’em. </span><span class="noHate">Is a Frenchman a man?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, den! </span><span class="noHate">Dad blame it, why doan’ he talk
      like a man? </span><span class="noHate">You answer me dat!” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I see it warn’t no use wasting words—you can’t learn a

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XV. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom of
      Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was after. </span><span class="noHate">We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio
      amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead
      to tie to, for it wouldn’t do to try to run in a fog; but when I
      paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn’t
      anything but little saplings to tie to. </span><span class="hate">I passed the line around one
      of them right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current,
      and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and
      away she went. </span><span class="noHate">I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick
      and scared I couldn’t budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me—and
      then there warn’t no raft in sight; you couldn’t see twenty
      yards. </span><span class="hate">I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and
      grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke. </span><span class="noHate">But she didn’t
      come. </span><span class="noHate">I was in such a hurry I hadn’t untied her. </span><span class="noHate">I got
      up and tried to untie her, but I was so excited my hands shook so I couldn’t
      hardly do anything with them. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right
      down the towhead. </span><span class="noHate">That was all right as far as it went, but the
      towhead warn’t sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot
      of it I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn’t no more idea
      which way I was going than a dead man. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Thinks I, it won’t do to paddle; first I know I’ll run into
      the bank or a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet
      it’s mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at
      such a time. </span><span class="noHate">I whooped and listened. </span><span class="noHate">Away down there
      somewheres I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits. </span><span class="noHate">I went
      tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again. </span><span class="noHate">The next time it
      come I see I warn’t heading for it, but heading away to the right of
      it. </span><span class="noHate">And the next time I was heading away to the left of it—and
      not gaining on it much either, for I was flying around, this way and that
      and t’other, but it was going straight ahead all the time. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the
      time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops
      that was making the trouble for me. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I fought along, and
      directly I hears the whoop behind me. </span><span class="noHate">I was tangled good now. </span><span class="noHate">That was somebody else’s whoop, or else I was turned around. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I throwed the paddle down. </span><span class="noHate">I heard the whoop again; it was behind me
      yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its
      place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again,
      and I knowed the current had swung the canoe’s head down-stream, and
      I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering. </span><span class="noHate">I couldn’t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don’t
      look natural nor sound natural in a fog. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut
      bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me off
      to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared, the
      currrent was tearing by them so swift. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">In another second or two it was solid white and still again. </span><span class="noHate">I set
      perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn’t
      draw a breath while it thumped a hundred. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I just give up then. </span><span class="noHate">I knowed what the matter was. </span><span class="noHate">That cut
      bank was an island, and Jim had gone down t’other side of it. </span><span class="noHate">It
      warn’t no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes. </span><span class="noHate">It
      had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long
      and more than half a mile wide. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. </span><span class="noHate">I
      was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don’t
      ever think of that. </span><span class="noHate">No, you feel like you are laying dead
      still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don’t
      think to yourself how fast you’re going, but you catch your
      breath and think, my! </span><span class="noHate">how that snag’s tearing along. </span><span class="noHate">If you
      think it ain’t dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself
      in the night, you try it once—you’ll see. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears the
      answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn’t do
      it, and directly I judged I’d got into a nest of towheads, for I had
      little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me—sometimes just a
      narrow channel between, and some that I couldn’t see I knowed was
      there because I’d hear the wash of the current against the old dead
      brush and trash that hung over the banks. </span><span class="hate">Well, I warn’t long
      loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase
      them a little while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o’-lantern. </span><span class="noHate">You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick
      and so much. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to keep
      from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must
      be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further
      ahead and clear out of hearing—it was floating a little faster than
      what I was. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn’t
      hear no sign of a whoop nowheres. </span><span class="noHate">I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a
      snag, maybe, and it was all up with him. </span><span class="noHate">I was good and tired, so I
      laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn’t bother no more. </span><span class="noHate">I
      didn’t want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn’t
      help it; so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars was
      shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a big bend
      stern first. </span><span class="noHate">First I didn’t know where I was; I thought I was
      dreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up
      dim out of last week. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest kind
      of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see by the
      stars. </span><span class="noHate">I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the
      water. </span><span class="noHate">I took after it; but when I got to it it warn’t nothing but a
      couple of sawlogs made fast together. </span><span class="noHate">Then I see another speck, and
      chased that; then another, and this time I was right. </span><span class="noHate">It was the
      raft. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his
      knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar. </span><span class="hate">The
      other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and
      branches and dirt. </span><span class="noHate">So she’d had a rough time. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I made fast and laid down under Jim’s nose on the raft, and began to
      gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hello, Jim, have I been asleep? </span><span class="noHate">Why didn’t you stir me
      up?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? </span><span class="noHate">En you ain’ dead—you
      ain’ drownded—you’s back agin? </span><span class="noHate">It’s too good
      for true, honey, it’s too good for true. </span><span class="noHate">Lemme look at you chile,
      lemme feel o’ you. </span><span class="noHate">No, you ain’ dead! </span><span class="noHate">you’s back
      agin, ’live en soun’, jis de same ole Huck—de same ole
      Huck, thanks to goodness!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What’s the matter with you, Jim? </span><span class="noHate">You been a-drinking?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Drinkin’? </span><span class="noHate">Has I ben a-drinkin’? </span><span class="noHate">Has I had a
      chance to be a-drinkin’?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“How does I talk wild?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“How? </span><span class="noHate">Why, hain’t you been talking about my
      coming back, and all that stuff, as if I’d been gone away?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Huck—Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye. </span><span class="noHate">Hain’t you ben gone away?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Gone away? </span><span class="noHate">Why, what in the nation do you mean? </span><span class="noHate">I hain’t
      been gone anywheres. </span><span class="noHate">Where would I go to?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, looky here, boss, dey’s sumf’n wrong, dey is. </span><span class="noHate">Is I me, or who is I? </span><span class="noHate">Is I heah, or whah is I? </span><span class="noHate">Now dat’s what I wants to know.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I think you’re here, plain enough, but I think you’re
      a tangle-headed old fool, Jim.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I is, is I? </span><span class="noHate">Well, you answer me dis: Didn’t you
      tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas’ to de tow-head?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, I didn’t. </span><span class="noHate">What tow-head? </span><span class="noHate">I hain’t see
      no tow-head.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You hain’t seen no towhead? </span><span class="noHate">Looky here, didn’t de
      line pull loose en de raf’ go a-hummin’ down de river, en
      leave you en de canoe behine in de fog?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What fog?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, de fog!—de fog dat’s been aroun’ all night. </span><span class="noHate">En didn’t you whoop, en didn’t I whoop, tell we got mix’ 
      up in de islands en one un us got los’ en t’other one was jis’ 
      as good as los’, ’kase he didn’ know whah he wuz? </span><span class="noHate">En
      didn’t I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time
      en mos’ git drownded? </span><span class="noHate">Now ain’ dat so, boss—ain’t
      it so? </span><span class="noHate">You answer me dat.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, this is too many for me, Jim. </span><span class="noHate">I hain’t seen no
      fog, nor no islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing. </span><span class="noHate">I been setting
      here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes
      ago, and I reckon I done the same. </span><span class="noHate">You couldn’t a got drunk in
      that time, so of course you’ve been dreaming.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn’t any
      of it happen.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But, Huck, it’s all jis’ as plain to me as—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It don’t make no difference how plain it is; there ain’t
      nothing in it. </span><span class="noHate">I know, because I’ve been here all the time.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Jim didn’t say nothing for about five minutes, but set there
      studying over it. </span><span class="noHate">Then he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, den, I reck’n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef
      it ain’t de powerfullest dream I ever see. </span><span class="noHate">En I hain’t
      ever had no dream b’fo’ dat’s tired me like dis one.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, well, that’s all right, because a dream does tire a body
      like everything sometimes. </span><span class="noHate">But this one was a staving dream; tell me
      all about it, Jim.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as it
      happened, only he painted it up considerable. </span><span class="noHate">Then he said he must
      start in and “’terpret” it, because it was sent for a
      warning. </span><span class="hate">He said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to
      do us some good, but the current was another man that would get us away
      from him. </span><span class="noHate">The whoops was warnings that would come to us every now
      and then, and if we didn’t try hard to make out to understand them
      they’d just take us into bad luck, ’stead of keeping us out of
      it. </span><span class="hate">The lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with
      quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks, but if we minded our
      business and didn’t talk back and aggravate them, we would pull
      through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river, which was the
      free States, and wouldn’t have no more trouble. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it was
      clearing up again now. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, well, that’s all interpreted well enough as far as it
      goes, Jim,” I says; “but what does these things stand
      for?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar. </span><span class="noHate">You
      could see them first-rate now. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash
      again. </span><span class="noHate">He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he
      couldn’t seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its
      place again right away. </span><span class="noHate">But when he did get the thing straightened
      around he looked at me steady without ever smiling, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What do dey stan’ for? </span><span class="noHate">I’se gwyne to tell you. </span><span class="noHate">When I got all wore out wid work, en wid de callin’ for you,
      en went to sleep, my heart wuz mos’ broke bekase you wuz los’,
      en I didn’ k’yer no’ mo’ what become er me en de
      raf’. </span><span class="noHate">En when I wake up en fine you back agin, all safe en
      soun’, de tears come, en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo’ 
      foot, I’s so thankful. </span><span class="noHate">En all you wuz thinkin’ ’bout wuz
      how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie. </span><span class="noHate">Dat truck dah is trash;
      en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren’s en
      makes ’em ashamed.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without
      saying anything but that. </span><span class="noHate">But that was enough. </span><span class="noHate">It made me feel
      so mean I could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it back. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble
      myself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn’t ever sorry for it
      afterwards, neither. </span><span class="noHate">I didn’t do him no more mean tricks, and
      I wouldn’t done that one if I’d a knowed it would make him
      feel that way. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XVI. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a
      monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. </span><span class="noHate">She
      had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as
      thirty men, likely. </span><span class="noHate">She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and
      an open camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. </span><span class="noHate">There
      was a power of style about her. </span><span class="noHate">It amounted to something
      being a raftsman on such a craft as that. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got
      hot. </span><span class="noHate">The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on
      both sides; you couldn’t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. </span><span class="noHate">We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we
      got to it. </span><span class="noHate">I said likely we wouldn’t, because I had heard say
      there warn’t but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn’t
      happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a
      town? </span><span class="noHate">Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there, that
      would show. </span><span class="noHate">But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot
      of an island and coming into the same old river again. </span><span class="noHate">That disturbed Jim—and
      me too. </span><span class="noHate">So the question was, what to do? </span><span class="noHate">I said, paddle ashore
      the first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along
      with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to
      know how far it was to Cairo. </span><span class="noHate">Jim thought it was a good idea, so we
      took a smoke on it and waited. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">There warn’t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town,
      and not pass it without seeing it. </span><span class="noHate">He said he’d be mighty sure
      to see it, because he’d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if
      he missed it he’d be in a slave country again and no more show for
      freedom. </span><span class="hate">Every little while he jumps up and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Dah she is?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But it warn’t. </span><span class="noHate">It was Jack-o’-lanterns, or lightning
      bugs; so he set down again, and went to watching, same as before. </span><span class="noHate">Jim
      said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too,
      to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he was
      most free—and who was to blame for it? </span><span class="noHate">Why, me. </span><span class="noHate">I
      couldn’t get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. </span><span class="noHate">It got to
      troubling me so I couldn’t rest; I couldn’t stay still in one
      place. </span><span class="noHate">It hadn’t ever come home to me before, what this thing
      was that I was doing. </span><span class="noHate">But now it did; and it stayed with me, and
      scorched me more and more. </span><span class="noHate">I tried to make out to myself that I warn’t
      to blame, because I didn’t run Jim off from his rightful owner; but
      it warn’t no use, conscience up and says, every time, “But you
      knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and
      told somebody.” That was so—I couldn’t get around
      that noway. </span><span class="noHate">That was where it pinched. </span><span class="hate">Conscience says to me,
      “What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger
      go off right under your eyes and never say one single word? </span><span class="noHate">What did
      that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? </span><span class="noHate">Why,
      she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she
      tried to be good to you every way she knowed how. </span><span class="noHate">That’s
      what she done.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. </span><span class="noHate">I
      fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was
      fidgeting up and down past me. </span><span class="noHate">We neither of us could keep still. </span><span class="noHate">Every time he danced around and says, “Dah’s Cairo!”
      it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it was Cairo I
      reckoned I would die of miserableness. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. </span><span class="hate">He
      was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he
      would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got
      enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where
      Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children,
      and if their master wouldn’t sell them, they’d get an Ab’litionist
      to go and steal them. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It most froze me to hear such talk. </span><span class="noHate">He wouldn’t ever dared to
      talk such talk in his life before. </span><span class="noHate">Just see what a difference it
      made in him the minute he judged he was about free. </span><span class="hate">It was according
      to the old saying, “Give a nigger an inch and he’ll take an
      ell.” Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking. </span><span class="hate">Here
      was this nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right
      out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children—children that
      belonged to a man I didn’t even know; a man that hadn’t ever
      done me no harm. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. </span><span class="noHate">My
      conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to
      it, “Let up on me—it ain’t too late yet—I’ll
      paddle ashore at the first light and tell.” I felt easy and
      happy and light as a feather right off. </span><span class="noHate">All my troubles was gone. </span><span class="noHate">I went to looking out sharp for a light, and sort of singing to
      myself. </span><span class="hate">By and by one showed. </span><span class="noHate">Jim sings out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“We’s safe, Huck, we’s safe! </span><span class="noHate">Jump up and crack yo’ 
      heels! </span><span class="noHate">Dat’s de good ole Cairo at las’, I jis knows it!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’ll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. </span><span class="noHate">It mightn’t
      be, you know.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom for
      me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Pooty soon I’ll be a-shout’n’ for joy, en I’ll
      say, it’s all on accounts o’ Huck; I’s a free man, en I
      couldn’t ever ben free ef it hadn’ ben for Huck; Huck done it. </span><span class="noHate">Jim won’t ever forgit you, Huck; you’s de bes’ 
      fren’ Jim’s ever had; en you’s de only fren’ 
      ole Jim’s got now.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says this,
      it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. </span><span class="noHate">I went along slow
      then, and I warn’t right down certain whether I was glad I started
      or whether I warn’t. </span><span class="noHate">When I was fifty yards off, Jim says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on’y white genlman dat
      ever kep’ his promise to ole Jim.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, I just felt sick. </span><span class="noHate">But I says, I got to do it—I
      can’t get out of it. </span><span class="noHate">Right then along comes a skiff
      with two men in it with guns, and they stopped and I stopped. </span><span class="hate">One of
      them says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What’s that yonder?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“A piece of a raft,” I says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Do you belong on it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, sir.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Any men on it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Only one, sir.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, there’s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above
      the head of the bend. </span><span class="hate">Is your man white or black?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I didn’t answer up prompt. </span><span class="noHate">I tried to, but the words wouldn’t
      come. </span><span class="noHate">I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn’t
      man enough—hadn’t the spunk of a rabbit. </span><span class="noHate">I see I was
      weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“He’s white.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I reckon we’ll go and see for ourselves.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I wish you would,” says I, “because it’s pap that’s
      there, and maybe you’d help me tow the raft ashore where the light
      is. </span><span class="noHate">He’s sick—and so is mam and Mary Ann.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, the devil! </span><span class="noHate">we’re in a hurry, boy. </span><span class="noHate">But I s’pose
      we’ve got to. </span><span class="noHate">Come, buckle to your paddle, and let’s get
      along.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. </span><span class="noHate">When we had made
      a stroke or two, I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Pap’ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. </span><span class="noHate">Everybody
      goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can’t
      do it by myself.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, that’s infernal mean. </span><span class="noHate">Odd, too. </span><span class="noHate">Say, boy,
      what’s the matter with your father?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s the—a—the—well, it ain’t
      anything much.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">They stopped pulling. </span><span class="noHate">It warn’t but a mighty little ways to
      the raft now. </span><span class="noHate">One says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Boy, that’s a lie. </span><span class="noHate">What is the matter with your
      pap? </span><span class="hate">Answer up square now, and it’ll be the better for you.” </span></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">“I will, sir, I will, honest—but don’t leave us, please. </span><span class="noHate">It’s the—the—Gentlemen, if you’ll only pull
      ahead, and let me heave you the headline, you won’t have to come
      a-near the raft—please do.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Set her back, John, set her back!” says one. </span><span class="noHate">They
      backed water. </span><span class="noHate">“Keep away, boy—keep to looard. </span><span class="noHate">Confound
      it, I just expect the wind has blowed it to us. </span><span class="noHate">Your pap’s got
      the small-pox, and you know it precious well. </span><span class="noHate">Why didn’t you
      come out and say so? </span><span class="hate">Do you want to spread it all over?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well,” says I, a-blubbering, “I’ve told everybody
      before, and they just went away and left us.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Poor devil, there’s something in that. </span><span class="hate">We are right
      down sorry for you, but we—well, hang it, we don’t want the
      small-pox, you see. </span><span class="noHate">Look here, I’ll tell you what to do. </span><span class="hate">Don’t you try to land by yourself, or you’ll smash
      everything to pieces. </span><span class="noHate">You float along down about twenty miles, and
      you’ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. </span><span class="hate">It
      will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them
      your folks are all down with chills and fever. </span><span class="noHate">Don’t be a fool
      again, and let people guess what is the matter. </span><span class="noHate">Now we’re
      trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that’s
      a good boy. </span><span class="noHate">It wouldn’t do any good to land yonder where the
      light is—it’s only a wood-yard. </span><span class="noHate">Say, I reckon your father’s
      poor, and I’m bound to say he’s in pretty hard luck. </span><span class="noHate">Here,
      I’ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board, and you get it
      when it floats by. </span><span class="noHate">I feel mighty mean to leave you; but my kingdom! </span><span class="noHate">it won’t do to fool with small-pox, don’t you see?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hold on, Parker,” says the other man, “here’s a
      twenty to put on the board for me. </span><span class="noHate">Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr.
      Parker told you, and you’ll be all right.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“That’s so, my boy—good-bye, good-bye. </span><span class="hate">If you see
      any runaway niggers you get help and nab them, and you can make some money
      by it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Good-bye, sir,” says I; “I won’t let no runaway
      niggers get by me if I can help it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I
      knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn’t no use for me
      to try to learn to do right; a body that don’t get started
      right when he’s little ain’t got no show—when the pinch
      comes there ain’t nothing to back him up and keep him to his work,
      and so he gets beat. </span><span class="noHate">Then I thought a minute, and says to myself,
      hold on; s’pose you’d a done right and give Jim up, would you
      felt better than what you do now? </span><span class="noHate">No, says I, I’d feel bad—I’d
      feel just the same way I do now. </span><span class="noHate">Well, then, says I, what’s
      the use you learning to do right when it’s troublesome to do right
      and ain’t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same? </span><span class="noHate">I was stuck. </span><span class="noHate">I couldn’t answer that. </span><span class="noHate">So I reckoned
      I wouldn’t bother no more about it, but after this always do
      whichever come handiest at the time. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I went into the wigwam; Jim warn’t there. </span><span class="noHate">I looked all around;
      he warn’t anywhere. </span><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Jim!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Here I is, Huck. </span><span class="noHate">Is dey out o’ sight yit? </span><span class="noHate">Don’t
      talk loud.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out. </span><span class="noHate">I
      told him they were out of sight, so he come aboard. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I was a-listenin’ to all de talk, en I slips into de river en
      was gwyne to shove for sho’ if dey come aboard. </span><span class="noHate">Den I was
      gwyne to swim to de raf’ agin when dey was gone. </span><span class="noHate">But lawsy,
      how you did fool ’em, Huck! </span><span class="noHate">Dat wuz de smartes’ 
      dodge! </span><span class="noHate">I tell you, chile, I’spec it save’ ole Jim—ole
      Jim ain’t going to forgit you for dat, honey.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then we talked about the money. </span><span class="noHate">It was a pretty good raise—twenty
      dollars apiece. </span><span class="noHate">Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat
      now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free
      States. </span><span class="noHate">He said twenty mile more warn’t far for the raft to go, but
      he wished we was already there. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding
      the raft good. </span><span class="noHate">Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and
      getting all ready to quit rafting. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in
      a left-hand bend. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I went off in the canoe to ask about it. </span><span class="noHate">Pretty soon I found a man
      out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. </span><span class="noHate">I ranged up and
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Mister, is that town Cairo?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Cairo? </span><span class="noHate">no. </span><span class="noHate">You must be a blame’ fool.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What town is it, mister?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“If you want to know, go and find out. </span><span class="noHate">If you stay here
      botherin’ around me for about a half a minute longer you’ll
      get something you won’t want.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I paddled to the raft. </span><span class="noHate">Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never
      mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but it
      was high ground, so I didn’t go. </span><span class="noHate">No high ground about Cairo,
      Jim said. </span><span class="noHate">I had forgot it. </span><span class="noHate">We laid up for the day on a towhead
      tolerable close to the left-hand bank. </span><span class="noHate">I begun to suspicion
      something. </span><span class="noHate">So did Jim. </span><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Doan’ le’s talk about it, Huck. </span><span class="hate">Po’ niggers
      can’t have no luck. </span><span class="noHate">I awluz ’spected dat
      rattlesnake-skin warn’t done wid its work.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I wish I’d never seen that snake-skin, Jim—I do wish I’d
      never laid eyes on it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It ain’t yo’ fault, Huck; you didn’ know. </span><span class="hate">Don’t
      you blame yo’self ’bout it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure enough,
      and outside was the old regular Muddy! </span><span class="noHate">So it was all up with Cairo. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We talked it all over. </span><span class="noHate">It wouldn’t do to take to the shore; we
      couldn’t take the raft up the stream, of course. </span><span class="hate">There warn’t
      no way but to wait for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the
      chances. </span><span class="hate">So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as
      to be fresh for the work, and when we went back to the raft about dark the
      canoe was gone! </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We didn’t say a word for a good while. </span><span class="noHate">There warn’t
      anything to say. </span><span class="noHate">We both knowed well enough it was some more work of
      the rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it? </span><span class="noHate">It would
      only look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more
      bad luck—and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep
      still. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn’t
      no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy
      a canoe to go back in. </span><span class="noHate">We warn’t going to borrow it when there
      warn’t anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set
      people after us. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So we shoved out after dark on the raft. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Anybody that don’t believe yet that it’s foolishness to handle
      a snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it
      now if they read on and see what more it done for us. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. </span><span class="noHate">But we
      didn’t see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours
      and more. </span><span class="noHate">Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the
      next meanest thing to fog. </span><span class="noHate">You can’t tell the shape of the
      river, and you can’t see no distance. </span><span class="noHate">It got to be very late and
      still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river. </span><span class="noHate">We lit the
      lantern, and judged she would see it. </span><span class="noHate">Up-stream boats didn’t
      generly come close to us; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for
      easy water under the reefs; but nights like this they bull right up the
      channel against the whole river. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We could hear her pounding along, but we didn’t see her good till
      she was close. </span><span class="noHate">She aimed right for us. </span><span class="hate">Often they do that and
      try to see how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel
      bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and
      thinks he’s mighty smart. </span><span class="noHate">Well, here she comes, and we said
      she was going to try and shave us; but she didn’t seem to be
      sheering off a bit. </span><span class="noHate">She was a big one, and she was coming in a
      hurry, too, looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it;
      but all of a sudden she bulged out, big and scary, with a long row of
      wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows
      and guards hanging right over us. </span><span class="noHate">There was a yell at us, and a
      jingling of bells to stop the engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling
      of steam—and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the other,
      she come smashing straight through the raft. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I dived—and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel
      had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. </span><span class="noHate">I
      could always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under
      a minute and a half. </span><span class="noHate">Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I
      was nearly busting. </span><span class="noHate">I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water
      out of my nose, and puffed a bit. </span><span class="hate">Of course there was a booming
      current; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds
      after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she
      was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though
      I could hear her. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn’t get any answer;
      so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was “treading water,”
      and struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. </span><span class="noHate">But I made out to
      see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which
      meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good
      long time in getting over. </span><span class="noHate">I made a safe landing, and clumb up the
      bank. </span><span class="noHate">I couldn’t see but a little ways, but I went poking along over
      rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a big
      old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it. </span><span class="hate">I was going to
      rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and
      barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XVII. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">In about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head
      out, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Be done, boys! </span><span class="noHate">Who’s there?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s me.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Who’s me?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“George Jackson, sir.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What do you want?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I don’t want nothing, sir. </span><span class="noHate">I only want to go along by,
      but the dogs won’t let me.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What are you prowling around here this time of night for—hey?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I warn’t prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the
      steamboat.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, you did, did you? </span><span class="noHate">Strike a light there, somebody. </span><span class="noHate">What
      did you say your name was?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“George Jackson, sir. </span><span class="noHate">I’m only a boy.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Look here, if you’re telling the truth you needn’t be
      afraid—nobody’ll hurt you. </span><span class="hate">But don’t try to budge;
      stand right where you are. </span><span class="noHate">Rouse out Bob and Tom, some of you, and
      fetch the guns. </span><span class="noHate">George Jackson, is there anybody with you?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, sir, nobody.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light. </span><span class="noHate">The
      man sung out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool—ain’t you
      got any sense? </span><span class="noHate">Put it on the floor behind the front door. </span><span class="noHate">Bob, if
      you and Tom are ready, take your places.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All ready.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“No, sir; I never heard of them.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, that may be so, and it mayn’t. </span><span class="noHate">Now, all ready. </span><span class="noHate">Step forward, George Jackson. </span><span class="noHate">And mind, don’t you hurry—come
      mighty slow. </span><span class="noHate">If there’s anybody with you, let him keep back—if
      he shows himself he’ll be shot. </span><span class="noHate">Come along now. </span><span class="hate">Come slow;
      push the door open yourself—just enough to squeeze in, d’ you
      hear?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I didn’t hurry; I couldn’t if I’d a wanted to. </span><span class="noHate">I
      took one slow step at a time and there warn’t a sound, only I
      thought I could hear my heart. </span><span class="noHate">The dogs were as still as the humans,
      but they followed a little behind me. </span><span class="noHate">When I got to the three log
      doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting. </span><span class="hate">I put
      my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody
      said, “There, that’s enough—put your head in.” I
      done it, but I judged they would take it off. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and me
      at them, for about a quarter of a minute: Three big men with guns
      pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray and about
      sixty, the other two thirty or more—all of them fine and handsome—and
      the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two young women which I
      couldn’t see right well. </span><span class="noHate">The old gentleman says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“There; I reckon it’s all right. </span><span class="noHate">Come in.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and
      bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and they all
      went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor, and got
      together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows—there
      warn’t none on the side. </span><span class="noHate">They held the candle, and took a good
      look at me, and all said, “Why, he ain’t a Shepherdson—no,
      there ain’t any Shepherdson about him.” Then the old man
      said he hoped I wouldn’t mind being searched for arms, because he
      didn’t mean no harm by it—it was only to make sure. </span><span class="noHate">So
      he didn’t pry into my pockets, but only felt outside with his hands,
      and said it was all right. </span><span class="noHate">He told me to make myself easy and at
      home, and tell all about myself; but the old lady says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing’s as wet as he can be;
      and don’t you reckon it may be he’s hungry?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“True for you, Rachel—I forgot.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So the old lady says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Betsy” (this was a nigger woman), “you fly around and
      get him something to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you
      girls go and wake up Buck and tell him—oh, here he is himself. </span><span class="noHate">Buck, take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him
      and dress him up in some of yours that’s dry.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Buck looked about as old as me—thirteen or fourteen or along there,
      though he was a little bigger than me. </span><span class="noHate">He hadn’t on anything
      but a shirt, and he was very frowzy-headed. </span><span class="noHate">He came in gaping and
      digging one fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the
      other one. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Ain’t they no Shepherdsons around?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">They said, no, ’twas a false alarm. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well,” he says, “if they’d a ben some, I reckon I’d
      a got one.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">They all laughed, and Bob says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you’ve been so
      slow in coming.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, nobody come after me, and it ain’t right I’m
      always kept down; I don’t get no show.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Never mind, Buck, my boy,” says the old man, “you’ll
      have show enough, all in good time, don’t you fret about that. </span><span class="noHate">Go ’long with you now, and do as your mother told you.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a
      roundabout and pants of his, and I put them on. </span><span class="noHate">While I was at it he
      asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to tell
      me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day
      before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went
      out. </span><span class="noHate">I said I didn’t know; I hadn’t heard about it
      before, no way. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, guess,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“How’m I going to guess,” says I, “when I never
      heard tell of it before?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But you can guess, can’t you? </span><span class="noHate">It’s just as easy.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Which candle?” I says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, any candle,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I don’t know where he was,” says I; “where was
      he?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Why, he was in the dark! </span><span class="noHate">That’s where he was!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, blame it, it’s a riddle, don’t you see? </span><span class="hate">Say,
      how long are you going to stay here? </span><span class="noHate">You got to stay always. </span><span class="noHate">We
      can just have booming times—they don’t have no school now. </span><span class="noHate">Do you own a dog? </span><span class="noHate">I’ve got a dog—and he’ll
      go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in. </span><span class="noHate">Do you like
      to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness? </span><span class="noHate">You bet I don’t,
      but ma she makes me. </span><span class="noHate">Confound these ole britches! </span><span class="noHate">I reckon I’d
      better put ’em on, but I’d ruther not, it’s so warm. </span><span class="noHate">Are you all ready? </span><span class="noHate">All right. </span><span class="noHate">Come along, old hoss.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk—that is what
      they had for me down there, and there ain’t nothing better that ever
      I’ve come across yet. </span><span class="hate">Buck and his ma and all of them smoked
      cob pipes, except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young
      women. </span><span class="noHate">They all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked. </span><span class="noHate">The
      young women had quilts around them, and their hair down their backs. </span><span class="hate">They all asked me questions, and I told them how pap and me and all
      the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and
      my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more,
      and Bill went to hunt them and he warn’t heard of no more, and Tom
      and Mort died, and then there warn’t nobody but just me and pap
      left, and he was just trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles;
      so when he died I took what there was left, because the farm didn’t
      belong to us, and started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard;
      and that was how I come to be here. </span><span class="noHate">So they said I could have a home
      there as long as I wanted it. </span><span class="noHate">Then it was most daylight and
      everybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in
      the morning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was. </span><span class="noHate">So I laid there
      about an hour trying to think, and when Buck waked up I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Can you spell, Buck?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I bet you can’t spell my name,” says I. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I bet you what you dare I can,” says he. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right,” says I, “go ahead.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n—there now,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well,” says I, “you done it, but I didn’t think
      you could. </span><span class="noHate">It ain’t no slouch of a name to spell—right
      off without studying.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I set it down, private, because somebody might want me to spell it
      next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was
      used to it. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too. </span><span class="noHate">I hadn’t
      seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much
      style. </span><span class="noHate">It didn’t have an iron latch on the front door, nor a
      wooden one with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as
      houses in town. </span><span class="noHate">There warn’t no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a
      bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them. </span><span class="hate">There was a big
      fireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean
      and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick;
      sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call
      Spanish-brown, same as they do in town. </span><span class="noHate">They had big brass dog-irons
      that could hold up a saw-log. </span><span class="hate">There was a clock on the middle of the
      mantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the
      glass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you
      could see the pendulum swinging behind it. </span><span class="noHate">It was beautiful to hear
      that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along
      and scoured her up and got her in good shape, she would start in and
      strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out. </span><span class="noHate">They wouldn’t
      took any money for her. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made
      out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. </span><span class="noHate">By one of the
      parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and
      when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn’t open their
      mouths nor look different nor interested. </span><span class="noHate">They squeaked through
      underneath. </span><span class="noHate">There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread
      out behind those things. </span><span class="noHate">On the table in the middle of the room was
      a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches
      and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier
      than real ones is, but they warn’t real because you could see where
      pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it was,
      underneath. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and blue
      spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. </span><span class="hate">It come
      all the way from Philadelphia, they said. </span><span class="noHate">There was some books, too,
      piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. </span><span class="noHate">One was a big
      family Bible full of pictures. </span><span class="noHate">One was Pilgrim’s Progress,
      about a man that left his family, it didn’t say why. </span><span class="noHate">I read
      considerable in it now and then. </span><span class="noHate">The statements was interesting, but
      tough. </span><span class="noHate">Another was Friendship’s Offering, full of beautiful
      stuff and poetry; but I didn’t read the poetry. </span><span class="noHate">Another was
      Henry Clay’s Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn’s Family
      Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead. </span><span class="noHate">There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books. </span><span class="noHate">And there was
      nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too—not bagged down
      in the middle and busted, like an old basket. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">They had pictures hung on the walls—mainly Washingtons and
      Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing
      the Declaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one
      of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only
      fifteen years old. </span><span class="noHate">They was different from any pictures I ever see
      before—blacker, mostly, than is common. </span><span class="hate">One was a woman in a
      slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a
      cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel
      bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black
      tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning
      pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her
      other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,
      and underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More
      Alas.” Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed
      up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb
      like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead
      bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and
      underneath the picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup
      More Alas.” There was one where a young lady was at a window
      looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an
      open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it,
      and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and
      underneath the picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone
      Alas.” These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn’t
      somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they
      always give me the fan-tods. </span><span class="noHate">Everybody was sorry she died, because
      she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see
      by what she had done what they had lost. </span><span class="noHate">But I reckoned that with
      her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard. </span><span class="hate">She
      was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick,
      and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till
      she got it done, but she never got the chance. </span><span class="hate">It was a picture of a
      young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all
      ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the
      moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded
      across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more
      reaching up towards the moon—and the idea was to see which pair
      would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was
      saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this
      picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday
      come they hung flowers on it. </span><span class="noHate">Other times it was hid with a little
      curtain. </span><span class="noHate">The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet
      face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to
      me. </span></p>

<p><span class="hate">This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste
      obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the
      Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head. </span><span class="noHate">It
      was very good poetry. </span><span class="noHate">This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of
      Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC’D </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">And did young Stephen sicken,  And did young Stephen
        die? </span><span class="noHate">And did the sad hearts thicken,  And did the
        mourners cry? </span><span class="noHate">No; such was not the fate of  Young
        Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad hearts round him thickened,
         ’Twas not from sickness’ shots. </span><span class="noHate">No
        whooping-cough did rack his frame,  Nor measles drear
        with spots; Not these impaired the sacred name  Of
        Stephen Dowling Bots. </span><span class="noHate">Despised love struck not with woe
         That head of curly knots, Nor stomach troubles laid
        him low,  Young Stephen Dowling Bots. </span><span class="noHate">O no. </span><span class="noHate">Then list with tearful eye,  Whilst I his fate do tell. </span><span class="noHate">His soul did from this cold world fly  By falling down
        a well. </span><span class="hate">They got him out and emptied him;  Alas
        it was too late; His spirit was gone for to sport aloft 
        In the realms of the good and great. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was
      fourteen, there ain’t no telling what she could a done by and by. </span><span class="noHate">Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. </span><span class="noHate">She didn’t
      ever have to stop to think. </span><span class="noHate">He said she would slap down a line, and
      if she couldn’t find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it
      out and slap down another one, and go ahead. </span><span class="noHate">She warn’t particular;
      she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just
      so it was sadful. </span><span class="noHate">Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died,
      she would be on hand with her “tribute” before he was cold. </span><span class="hate">She called them tributes. </span><span class="noHate">The neighbors said it was the doctor
      first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker—the undertaker never got
      in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the
      dead person’s name, which was Whistler. </span><span class="noHate">She warn’t ever
      the same after that; she never complained, but she kinder pined away and
      did not live long. </span><span class="noHate">Poor thing, many’s the time I made myself
      go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old
      scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I
      had soured on her a little. </span><span class="noHate">I liked all that family, dead ones and
      all, and warn’t going to let anything come between us. </span><span class="noHate">Poor
      Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive, and it
      didn’t seem right that there warn’t nobody to make some about
      her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I
      couldn’t seem to make it go somehow. </span><span class="noHate">They kept Emmeline’s
      room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked
      to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there. </span><span class="noHate">The
      old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of
      niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on
      the windows: white, with pictures painted on them of castles with
      vines all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink. </span><span class="noHate">There was
      a little old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing
      was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing “The Last Link
      is Broken” and play “The Battle of Prague” on it. </span><span class="noHate">The
      walls of all the rooms was plastered, and most had carpets on the floors,
      and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and
      floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day,
      and it was a cool, comfortable place. </span><span class="noHate">Nothing couldn’t be
      better. </span><span class="noHate">And warn’t the cooking good, and just bushels of it
      too! </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XVIII. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Col. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. </span><span class="noHate">He was a gentleman
      all over; and so was his family. </span><span class="noHate">He was well born, as the saying is,
      and that’s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow
      Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy
      in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn’t no
      more quality than a mudcat himself. </span><span class="hate">Col. Grangerford was very
      tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red
      in it anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face,
      and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils,
      and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk
      so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you,
      as you may say. </span><span class="noHate">His forehead was high, and his hair was black and
      straight and hung to his shoulders. </span><span class="noHate">His hands was long and thin, and every
      day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot
      made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays
      he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. </span><span class="noHate">He carried a
      mahogany cane with a silver head to it. </span><span class="hate">There warn’t no
      frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn’t ever loud. </span><span class="noHate">He
      was as kind as he could be—you could feel that, you know, and so you
      had confidence. </span><span class="noHate">Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but
      when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning
      begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree
      first, and find out what the matter was afterwards. </span><span class="noHate">He didn’t
      ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners—everybody was always
      good-mannered where he was. </span><span class="noHate">Everybody loved to have him around, too;
      he was sunshine most always—I mean he made it seem like good
      weather. </span><span class="noHate">When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half
      a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn’t nothing go wrong again
      for a week. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up
      out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn’t set down
      again till they had set down. </span><span class="hate">Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard
      where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him,
      and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom’s and Bob’s was
      mixed, and then they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and
      madam;” and they bowed the least bit in the world and said
      thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful
      of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom
      of their tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old
      people too. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Bob was the oldest and Tom next—tall, beautiful men with very broad
      shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. </span><span class="noHate">They
      dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and wore
      broad Panama hats. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud and
      grand, but as good as she could be when she warn’t stirred up; but
      when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like
      her father. </span><span class="noHate">She was beautiful. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. </span><span class="noHate">She was
      gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Each person had their own nigger to wait on them—Buck too. </span><span class="hate">My
      nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn’t used to having
      anybody do anything for me, but Buck’s was on the jump most of the
      time. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be more—three
      sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers. </span><span class="hate">Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or
      fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings
      round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods
      daytimes, and balls at the house nights. </span><span class="noHate">These people was mostly
      kinfolks of the family. </span><span class="noHate">The men brought their guns with them. </span><span class="noHate">It
      was a handsome lot of quality, I tell you. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">There was another clan of aristocracy around there—five or six
      families—mostly of the name of Shepherdson. </span><span class="hate">They was as
      high-toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords. </span><span class="hate">The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing,
      which was about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up
      there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons
      there on their fine horses. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse
      coming. </span><span class="noHate">We was crossing the road. </span><span class="noHate">Buck says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Quick! </span><span class="noHate">Jump for the woods!” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. </span><span class="noHate">Pretty
      soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his horse
      easy and looking like a soldier. </span><span class="noHate">He had his gun across his pommel. </span><span class="noHate">I had seen him before. </span><span class="noHate">It was young Harney Shepherdson. </span><span class="noHate">I
      heard Buck’s gun go off at my ear, and Harney’s hat tumbled
      off from his head. </span><span class="noHate">He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place
      where we was hid. </span><span class="noHate">But we didn’t wait. </span><span class="noHate">We started through
      the woods on a run. </span><span class="noHate">The woods warn’t thick, so I looked over
      my shoulder to dodge the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with
      his gun; and then he rode away the way he come—to get his hat, I
      reckon, but I couldn’t see. </span><span class="hate">We never stopped running till we
      got home. </span><span class="noHate">The old gentleman’s eyes blazed a minute—’twas
      pleasure, mainly, I judged—then his face sort of smoothed down, and
      he says, kind of gentle: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I don’t like that shooting from behind a bush. </span><span class="noHate">Why didn’t
      you step into the road, my boy?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The Shepherdsons don’t, father. </span><span class="hate">They always take
      advantage.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling
      his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped. </span><span class="noHate">The two
      young men looked dark, but never said nothing. </span><span class="noHate">Miss Sophia she
      turned pale, but the color come back when she found the man warn’t
      hurt. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by
      ourselves, I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Did you want to kill him, Buck?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I bet I did.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What did he do to you?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Him? </span><span class="noHate">He never done nothing to me.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, nothing—only it’s on account of the feud.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What’s a feud?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, where was you raised? </span><span class="noHate">Don’t you know what a feud
      is?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Never heard of it before—tell me about it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well,” says Buck, “a feud is this way: A man has
      a quarrel with another man, and kills him; then that other man’s
      brother kills him; then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for
      one another; then the cousins chip in—and by and by everybody’s
      killed off, and there ain’t no more feud. </span><span class="hate">But it’s kind
      of slow, and takes a long time.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Has this one been going on long, Buck?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I should reckon! </span><span class="noHate">It started thirty year ago, or
      som’ers along there. </span><span class="noHate">There was trouble ’bout something,
      and then a lawsuit to settle it; and the suit went agin one of the men,
      and so he up and shot the man that won the suit—which he would
      naturally do, of course. </span><span class="noHate">Anybody would.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What was the trouble about, Buck?—land?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I reckon maybe—I don’t know.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, who done the shooting? </span><span class="noHate">Was it a Grangerford or a
      Shepherdson?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Laws, how do I know? </span><span class="noHate">It was so long ago.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Don’t anybody know?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but
      they don’t know now what the row was about in the first place.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Has there been many killed, Buck?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes; right smart chance of funerals. </span><span class="hate">But they don’t
      always kill. </span><span class="noHate">Pa’s got a few buckshot in him; but he don’t
      mind it ’cuz he don’t weigh much, anyway. </span><span class="noHate">Bob’s
      been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom’s been hurt once or twice.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Yes; we got one and they got one. </span><span class="hate">’Bout three months
      ago my cousin Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t’other
      side of the river, and didn’t have no weapon with him, which was
      blame’ foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse
      a-coming behind him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin’ after
      him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and
      ’stead of jumping off and taking to the brush, Bud ’lowed he
      could out-run him; so they had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more,
      the old man a-gaining all the time; so at last Bud seen it warn’t
      any use, so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in
      front, you know, and the old man he rode up and shot him down. </span><span class="noHate">But
      he didn’t git much chance to enjoy his luck, for inside of a week
      our folks laid him out.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I reckon he warn’t a coward. </span><span class="hate">Not by a blame’ 
      sight. </span><span class="noHate">There ain’t a coward amongst them Shepherdsons—not
      a one. </span><span class="noHate">And there ain’t no cowards amongst the Grangerfords
      either. </span><span class="noHate">Why, that old man kep’ up his end in a fight one day
      for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come out winner. </span><span class="hate">They
      was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little
      woodpile, and kep’ his horse before him to stop the bullets; but the
      Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man, and
      peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them. </span><span class="hate">Him and his
      horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the Grangerfords had
      to be fetched home—and one of ’em was dead, and another
      died the next day. </span><span class="noHate">No, sir; if a body’s out hunting for
      cowards he don’t want to fool away any time amongst them
      Shepherdsons, becuz they don’t breed any of that kind.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody
      a-horseback. </span><span class="noHate">The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept them
      between their knees or stood them handy against the wall. </span><span class="noHate">The
      Shepherdsons done the same. </span><span class="noHate">It was pretty ornery preaching—all
      about brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it
      was a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a
      powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and
      preforeordestination, and I don’t know what all, that it did seem to
      me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their
      chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. </span><span class="noHate">Buck
      and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. </span><span class="noHate">I
      went up to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. </span><span class="noHate">I found
      that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and
      she took me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I
      liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for
      her and not tell anybody, and I said I would. </span><span class="noHate">Then she said she’d
      forgot her Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other
      books, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and
      not say nothing to nobody. </span><span class="noHate">I said I would. </span><span class="noHate">So I slid out and slipped
      off up the road, and there warn’t anybody at the church, except
      maybe a hog or two, for there warn’t any lock on the door, and hogs
      likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it’s cool. </span><span class="noHate">If
      you notice, most folks don’t go to church only when they’ve
      got to; but a hog is different. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Says I to myself, something’s up; it ain’t natural for a girl
      to be in such a sweat about a Testament. </span><span class="noHate">So I give it a shake, and
      out drops a little piece of paper with “HALF-PAST TWO” wrote
      on it with a pencil. </span><span class="noHate">I ransacked it, but couldn’t find
      anything else. </span><span class="noHate">I couldn’t make anything out of that, so I put
      the paper in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs there was
      Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. </span><span class="noHate">She pulled me in and shut
      the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper, and
      as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before a body could think she
      grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I was the best boy in the
      world, and not to tell anybody. </span><span class="noHate">She was mighty red in the face for a
      minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it made her powerful pretty. </span><span class="noHate">I
      was a good deal astonished, but when I got my breath I asked her what the
      paper was about, and she asked me if I had read it, and I said no, and she
      asked me if I could read writing, and I told her “no, only
      coarse-hand,” and then she said the paper warn’t anything but
      a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and play now. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon I
      noticed that my nigger was following along behind. </span><span class="noHate">When we was out
      of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes
      a-running, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Mars Jawge, if you’ll come down into de swamp I’ll show
      you a whole stack o’ water-moccasins.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Thinks I, that’s mighty curious; he said that yesterday. </span><span class="noHate">He
      oughter know a body don’t love water-moccasins enough to go around
      hunting for them. </span><span class="noHate">What is he up to, anyway? </span><span class="noHate">So I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right; trot ahead.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded
      ankle deep as much as another half-mile. </span><span class="noHate">We come to a little flat
      piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and
      vines, and he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah’s
      whah dey is. </span><span class="noHate">I’s seed ’m befo’; I don’t k’yer
      to see ’em no mo’.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid
      him. </span><span class="noHate">I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch
      as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying
      there asleep—and, by jings, it was my old Jim! </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him
      to see me again, but it warn’t. </span><span class="hate">He nearly cried he was so
      glad, but he warn’t surprised. </span><span class="hate">Said he swum along behind me
      that night, and heard me yell every time, but dasn’t answer, because
      he didn’t want nobody to pick him up and take him into
      slavery again. </span><span class="noHate">Says he: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I got hurt a little, en couldn’t swim fas’, so I wuz a
      considable ways behine you towards de las’; when you landed I reck’ned
      I could ketch up wid you on de lan’ ’dout havin’ to
      shout at you, but when I see dat house I begin to go slow. </span><span class="noHate">I ’uz
      off too fur to hear what dey say to you—I wuz ’fraid o’ 
      de dogs; but when it ’uz all quiet agin I knowed you’s in de
      house, so I struck out for de woods to wait for day. </span><span class="noHate">Early in de
      mawnin’ some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey
      tuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can’t track me on
      accounts o’ de water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en
      tells me how you’s a-gitt’n along.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why didn’t you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, ’twarn’t no use to ’sturb you, Huck, tell
      we could do sumfn—but we’s all right now. </span><span class="noHate">I ben a-buyin’ 
      pots en pans en vittles, as I got a chanst, en a-patchin’ up de raf’ 
      nights when—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What raft, Jim?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Our ole raf’.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“You mean to say our old raft warn’t smashed all to flinders?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, she warn’t. </span><span class="noHate">She was tore up a good deal—one
      en’ of her was; but dey warn’t no great harm done, on’y
      our traps was mos’ all los’. </span><span class="noHate">Ef we hadn’ dive’ 
      so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night hadn’ ben so dark,
      en we warn’t so sk’yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin’ 
      is, we’d a seed de raf’. </span><span class="noHate">But it’s jis’ as
      well we didn’t, ’kase now she’s all fixed up agin mos’ 
      as good as new, en we’s got a new lot o’ stuff, in de place o’ 
      what ’uz los’.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim—did you
      catch her?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods? </span><span class="noHate">No; some er de
      niggers foun’ her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben’, en
      dey hid her in a crick ’mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin’ 
      ’bout which un ’um she b’long to de mos’ dat I
      come to heah ’bout it pooty soon, so I ups en settles de trouble by
      tellin’ ’um she don’t b’long to none uv um, but to
      you en me; en I ast ’m if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman’s
      propaty, en git a hid’n for it? </span><span class="noHate">Den I gin ’m ten cents
      apiece, en dey ’uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo’ 
      raf’s ’ud come along en make ’m rich agin. </span><span class="noHate">Dey’s
      mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en whatever I wants ’m to do fur
      me I doan’ have to ast ’m twice, honey. </span><span class="hate">Dat Jack’s
      a good nigger, en pooty smart.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, he is. </span><span class="noHate">He ain’t ever told me you was here; told me
      to come, and he’d show me a lot of water-moccasins. </span><span class="noHate">If
      anything happens he ain’t mixed up in it. </span><span class="hate">He can say he
      never seen us together, and it ’ll be the truth.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I don’t want to talk much about the next day. </span><span class="noHate">I reckon I’ll
      cut it pretty short. </span><span class="noHate">I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn
      over and go to sleep again when I noticed how still it was—didn’t
      seem to be anybody stirring. </span><span class="noHate">That warn’t usual. </span><span class="noHate">Next I
      noticed that Buck was up and gone. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes
      down stairs—nobody around; everything as still as a mouse. </span><span class="noHate">Just
      the same outside. </span><span class="noHate">Thinks I, what does it mean? </span><span class="noHate">Down by the
      wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What’s it all about?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Says he: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Don’t you know, Mars Jawge?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No,” says I, “I don’t.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, den, Miss Sophia’s run off! </span><span class="noHate">’deed she has. </span><span class="noHate">She
      run off in de night some time—nobody don’t know jis’ 
      when; run off to get married to dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know—leastways,
      so dey ’spec. </span><span class="noHate">De fambly foun’ it out ’bout half an
      hour ago—maybe a little mo’—en’ I tell you
      dey warn’t no time los’. </span><span class="noHate">Sich another hurryin’ up
      guns en hosses you never see! </span><span class="noHate">De women folks has gone for to
      stir up de relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up
      de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him ’fo’ 
      he kin git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia. </span><span class="noHate">I reck’n dey’s
      gwyne to be mighty rough times.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Buck went off ’thout waking me up.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I reck’n he did! </span><span class="noHate">Dey warn’t gwyne to
      mix you up in it. </span><span class="noHate">Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en ’lowed he’s
      gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson or bust. </span><span class="noHate">Well, dey’ll be plenty un
      ’m dah, I reck’n, en you bet you he’ll fetch one ef he
      gits a chanst.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I took up the river road as hard as I could put. </span><span class="noHate">By and by I begin
      to hear guns a good ways off. </span><span class="hate">When I come in sight of the log store
      and the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees
      and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the forks
      of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched. </span><span class="noHate">There was a
      wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I
      was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn’t. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open
      place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at a
      couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the
      steamboat landing; but they couldn’t come it. </span><span class="hate">Every time one
      of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at. </span><span class="hate">The two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they
      could watch both ways. </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. </span><span class="hate">They started
      riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady
      bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. </span><span class="hate">All
      the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to
      carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the run. </span><span class="noHate">They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed. </span><span class="hate">Then
      the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them. </span><span class="noHate">They gained on the boys, but it didn’t do no good, the boys
      had too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my
      tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men
      again. </span><span class="noHate">One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about
      nineteen years old. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. </span><span class="noHate">As soon as they
      was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. </span><span class="noHate">He didn’t
      know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first. </span><span class="hate">He
      was awful surprised. </span><span class="noHate">He told me to watch out sharp and let him know
      when the men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or
      other—wouldn’t be gone long. </span><span class="noHate">I wished I was out of that
      tree, but I dasn’t come down. </span><span class="hate">Buck begun to cry and rip, and
      ’lowed that him and his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap)
      would make up for this day yet. </span><span class="noHate">He said his father and his two
      brothers was killed, and two or three of the enemy. </span><span class="noHate">Said the
      Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush. </span><span class="noHate">Buck said his father and
      brothers ought to waited for their relations—the Shepherdsons was
      too strong for them. </span><span class="noHate">I asked him what was become of young Harney and
      Miss Sophia. </span><span class="noHate">He said they’d got across the river and was safe. </span><span class="noHate">I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because he didn’t
      manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him—I hain’t ever
      heard anything like it. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">All of a sudden, bang! </span><span class="noHate">bang! </span><span class="noHate">bang! </span><span class="noHate">goes three or four guns—the men
      had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their
      horses! </span><span class="hate">The boys jumped for the river—both of them hurt—and
      as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them
      and singing out, “Kill them, kill them!” It made me so
      sick I most fell out of the tree. </span><span class="noHate">I ain’t a-going to tell all
      that happened—it would make me sick again if I was to do that. </span><span class="noHate">I wished I hadn’t ever come ashore that night to see such
      things. </span><span class="noHate">I ain’t ever going to get shut of them—lots of
      times I dream about them. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down. </span><span class="hate">Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little
      gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the
      trouble was still a-going on. </span><span class="noHate">I was mighty downhearted; so I made up
      my mind I wouldn’t ever go anear that house again, because I
      reckoned I was to blame, somehow. </span><span class="noHate">I judged that that piece of paper meant
      that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run
      off; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the
      curious way she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this
      awful mess wouldn’t ever happened. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a piece,
      and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and tugged at
      them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away
      as quick as I could. </span><span class="noHate">I cried a little when I was covering up Buck’s
      face, for he was mighty good to me. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">It was just dark now. </span><span class="noHate">I never went near the house, but struck
      through the woods and made for the swamp. </span><span class="noHate">Jim warn’t on his
      island, so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the
      willows, red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country. </span><span class="noHate">The
      raft was gone! </span><span class="noHate">My souls, but I was scared! </span><span class="noHate">I couldn’t
      get my breath for most a minute. </span><span class="noHate">Then I raised a yell. </span><span class="noHate">A voice not
      twenty-five foot from me says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Good lan’! </span><span class="noHate">is dat you, honey? </span><span class="noHate">Doan’ make no
      noise.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was Jim’s voice—nothing ever sounded so good before. </span><span class="noHate">I
      run along the bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and
      hugged me, he was so glad to see me. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Laws bless you, chile, I ’uz right down sho’ you’s
      dead agin. </span><span class="noHate">Jack’s been heah; he say he reck’n you’s
      ben shot, kase you didn’ come home no mo’; so I’s jes’ 
      dis minute a startin’ de raf’ down towards de mouf er de
      crick, so’s to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack
      comes agin en tells me for certain you is dead. </span><span class="noHate">Lawsy, I’s
      mighty glad to git you back again, honey.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right—that’s mighty good; they won’t find me,
      and they’ll think I’ve been killed, and floated down the river—there’s
      something up there that ’ll help them think so—so don’t
      you lose no time, Jim, but just shove off for the big water as fast as
      ever you can.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the
      middle of the Mississippi. </span><span class="noHate">Then we hung up our signal lantern, and
      judged that we was free and safe once more. </span><span class="noHate">I hadn’t had a
      bite to eat since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and
      buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and greens—there ain’t
      nothing in the world so good when it’s cooked right—and whilst
      I eat my supper we talked and had a good time. </span><span class="hate">I was powerful glad
      to get away from the feuds, and so was Jim to get away from the swamp. </span><span class="noHate">We said there warn’t no home like a raft, after all. </span><span class="noHate">Other
      places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don’t. </span><span class="noHate">You
      feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft. </span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XIX. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Two or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,
      they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. </span><span class="noHate">Here is the way we
      put in the time. </span><span class="noHate">It was a monstrous big river down there—sometimes
      a mile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon
      as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up—nearly
      always in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods
      and willows, and hid the raft with them. </span><span class="noHate">Then we set out the lines. </span><span class="noHate">Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and
      cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about
      knee deep, and watched the daylight come. </span><span class="noHate">Not a sound anywheres—perfectly
      still—just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the
      bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe. </span><span class="hate">The first thing to see, looking away
      over the water, was a kind of dull line—that was the woods on t’other
      side; you couldn’t make nothing else out; then a pale place in the
      sky; then more paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away
      off, and warn’t black any more, but gray; you could see little dark
      spots drifting along ever so far away—trading scows, and such
      things; and long black streaks—rafts; sometimes you could hear a
      sweep screaking; or jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so
      far; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by
      the look of the streak that there’s a snag there in a swift current
      which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the
      mist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and
      you make out a log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t’other
      side of the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so
      you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up,
      and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to
      smell on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,
      because they’ve left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and
      they do get pretty rank; and next you’ve got the full day, and
      everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it! </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">A little smoke couldn’t be noticed now, so we would take some fish
      off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast. </span><span class="hate">And afterwards we
      would watch the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by
      and by lazy off to sleep. </span><span class="noHate">Wake up by and by, and look to see what
      done it, and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off
      towards the other side you couldn’t tell nothing about her only
      whether she was a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there
      wouldn’t be nothing to hear nor nothing to see—just solid
      lonesomeness. </span><span class="noHate">Next you’d see a raft sliding by, away off
      yonder, and maybe a galoot on it chopping, because they’re most
      always doing it on a raft; you’d see the axe flash and come down—you
      don’t hear nothing; you see that axe go up again, and by the time it’s
      above the man’s head then you hear the k’chunk!—it
      had took all that time to come over the water. </span><span class="hate">So we would put in
      the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness. </span><span class="hate">Once there was
      a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so
      the steamboats wouldn’t run over them. </span><span class="hate">A scow or a raft went
      by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing—heard
      them plain; but we couldn’t see no sign of them; it made you feel
      crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air. </span><span class="noHate">Jim
      said he believed it was spirits; but I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No; spirits wouldn’t say, ‘Dern the dern fog.’” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the
      middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted her
      to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and talked
      about all kinds of things—we was always naked, day and night,
      whenever the mosquitoes would let us—the new clothes Buck’s
      folks made for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn’t
      go much on clothes, nohow. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Sometimes we’d have that whole river all to ourselves for the
      longest time. </span><span class="noHate">Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and
      maybe a spark—which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on
      the water you could see a spark or two—on a raft or a scow, you
      know; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of
      them crafts. </span><span class="noHate">It’s lovely to live on a raft. </span><span class="noHate">We had the sky up
      there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look
      up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. </span><span class="hate">Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged
      it would have took too long to make so many. </span><span class="noHate">Jim said the
      moon could a laid them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I
      didn’t say nothing against it, because I’ve seen a frog lay
      most as many, so of course it could be done. </span><span class="noHate">We used to watch the stars
      that fell, too, and see them streak down. </span><span class="noHate">Jim allowed they’d
      got spoiled and was hove out of the nest. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the
      dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of
      her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful
      pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her
      powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her waves
      would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the raft a
      bit, and after that you wouldn’t hear nothing for you couldn’t
      tell how long, except maybe frogs or something. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or three
      hours the shores was black—no more sparks in the cabin windows. </span><span class="noHate">These sparks was our clock—the first one that showed again
      meant morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right
      away. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the
      main shore—it was only two hundred yards—and paddled about a
      mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn’t get
      some berries. </span><span class="noHate">Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath
      crossed the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight
      as they could foot it. </span><span class="noHate">I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody
      was after anybody I judged it was me—or maybe Jim. </span><span class="noHate">I
      was about to dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to
      me then, and sung out and begged me to save their lives—said they
      hadn’t been doing nothing, and was being chased for it—said
      there was men and dogs a-coming. </span><span class="noHate">They wanted to jump right in, but I
      says: </span></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Don’t you do it. </span><span class="noHate">I don’t hear the dogs and horses
      yet; you’ve got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick
      a little ways; then you take to the water and wade down to me and get in—that’ll
      throw the dogs off the scent.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead, and
      in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,
      shouting. </span><span class="hate">We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn’t
      see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got
      further and further away all the time, we couldn’t hardly hear them
      at all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the
      river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in
      the cottonwoods and was safe. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head and
      very gray whiskers. </span><span class="noHate">He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and a
      greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into
      his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses—no, he only had one. </span><span class="noHate">He
      had an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over
      his arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery. </span><span class="noHate">After
      breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out
      was that these chaps didn’t know one another. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What got you into trouble?” says the baldhead to t’other
      chap. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I’d been selling an article to take the tartar off the
      teeth—and it does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along
      with it—but I stayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was
      just in the act of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this
      side of town, and you told me they were coming, and begged me to help you
      to get off. </span><span class="noHate">So I told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would
      scatter out with you. </span><span class="noHate">That’s the whole yarn—what’s
      yourn? </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, I’d ben a-running’ a little temperance revival
      thar ’bout a week, and was the pet of the women folks, big and
      little, for I was makin’ it mighty warm for the rummies, I tell
      you, and takin’ as much as five or six dollars a night—ten
      cents a head, children and niggers free—and business a-growin’ 
      all the time, when somehow or another a little report got around last
      night that I had a way of puttin’ in my time with a private jug on
      the sly. </span><span class="noHate">A nigger rousted me out this mornin’, and told me the
      people was getherin’ on the quiet with their dogs and horses, and
      they’d be along pretty soon and give me ’bout half an hour’s
      start, and then run me down if they could; and if they got me they’d
      tar and feather me and ride me on a rail, sure. </span><span class="noHate">I didn’t wait
      for no breakfast—I warn’t hungry.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Old man,” said the young one, “I reckon we might
      double-team it together; what do you think?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I ain’t undisposed. </span><span class="hate">What’s your line—mainly?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines;
      theater-actor—tragedy, you know; take a turn to mesmerism and
      phrenology when there’s a chance; teach singing-geography school for
      a change; sling a lecture sometimes—oh, I do lots of things—most
      anything that comes handy, so it ain’t work. </span><span class="hate">What’s your
      lay?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’ve done considerble in the doctoring way in my time. </span><span class="noHate">Layin’ 
      on o’ hands is my best holt—for cancer and paralysis, and sich
      things; and I k’n tell a fortune pretty good when I’ve got
      somebody along to find out the facts for me. </span><span class="noHate">Preachin’s my
      line, too, and workin’ camp-meetin’s, and missionaryin’ 
      around.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Nobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh and
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Alas!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What ’re you alassin’ about?” says the bald-head. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be
      degraded down into such company.” And he begun to wipe the
      corner of his eye with a rag. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Dern your skin, ain’t the company good enough for you?”
      says the baldhead, pretty pert and uppish. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, it is good enough for me; it’s as good as I
      deserve; for who fetched me so low when I was so high? </span><span class="noHate">I did myself. </span><span class="noHate">I don’t blame you, gentlemen—far from it; I don’t
      blame anybody. </span><span class="noHate">I deserve it all. </span><span class="noHate">Let the cold world do its
      worst; one thing I know—there’s a grave somewhere for me. </span><span class="hate">The
      world may go on just as it’s always done, and take everything from
      me—loved ones, property, everything; but it can’t take that. </span><span class="noHate">Some day I’ll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken
      heart will be at rest.” He went on a-wiping. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Drot your pore broken heart,” says the baldhead; “what
      are you heaving your pore broken heart at us f’r? </span><span class="noHate">we
      hain’t done nothing.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, I know you haven’t. </span><span class="noHate">I ain’t blaming you,
      gentlemen. </span><span class="noHate">I brought myself down—yes, I did it myself. </span><span class="noHate">It’s
      right I should suffer—perfectly right—I don’t make any
      moan.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Brought you down from whar? </span><span class="noHate">Whar was you brought down from?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes—let it
      pass—’tis no matter. </span><span class="noHate">The secret of my birth—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The secret of your birth! </span><span class="noHate">Do you mean to say—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Gentlemen,” says the young man, very solemn, “I will
      reveal it to you, for I feel I may have confidence in you. </span><span class="noHate">By rights
      I am a duke!” </span></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Jim’s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did,
      too. </span><span class="noHate">Then the baldhead says: “No! </span><span class="noHate">you can’t mean it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes. </span><span class="noHate">My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of
      Bridgewater, fled to this country about the end of the last century, to
      breathe the pure air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son,
      his own father dying about the same time. </span><span class="noHate">The second son of the late
      duke seized the titles and estates—the infant real duke was ignored. </span><span class="noHate">I am the lineal descendant of that infant—I am the rightful
      Duke of Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate,
      hunted of men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and
      degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. </span><span class="hate">We tried to comfort him, but he
      said it warn’t much use, he couldn’t be much comforted; said
      if we was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most
      anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. </span><span class="hate">He said
      we ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say “Your Grace,” or
      “My Lord,” or “Your Lordship”—and he wouldn’t
      mind it if we called him plain “Bridgewater,” which, he said,
      was a title anyway, and not a name; and one of us ought to wait on him at
      dinner, and do any little thing for him he wanted done. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, that was all easy, so we done it. </span><span class="noHate">All through dinner Jim stood
      around and waited on him, and says, “Will yo’ Grace have some
      o’ dis or some o’ dat?” and so on, and a body could see
      it was mighty pleasing to him. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But the old man got pretty silent by and by—didn’t have much
      to say, and didn’t look pretty comfortable over all that petting
      that was going on around that duke. </span><span class="noHate">He seemed to have something on
      his mind. </span><span class="noHate">So, along in the afternoon, he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Looky here, Bilgewater,” he says, “I’m nation
      sorry for you, but you ain’t the only person that’s had
      troubles like that.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No you ain’t. </span><span class="noHate">You ain’t the only person that’s
      ben snaked down wrongfully out’n a high place.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Alas!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, you ain’t the only person that’s had a secret of
      his birth.” And, by jings, he begins to cry. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hold! </span><span class="noHate">What do you mean?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Bilgewater, kin I trust you?” says the old man, still sort of
      sobbing. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“To the bitter death!” He took the old man by the hand
      and squeezed it, and says, “That secret of your being: speak!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">You bet you, Jim and me stared this time. </span><span class="noHate">Then the duke says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You are what?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, my friend, it is too true—your eyes is lookin’ at
      this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son
      of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You! </span><span class="noHate">At your age! </span><span class="noHate">No! </span><span class="noHate">You mean you’re the
      late Charlemagne; you must be six or seven hundred years old, at the very
      least.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has
      brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude. </span><span class="noHate">Yes, gentlemen,
      you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin’, exiled,
      trampled-on, and sufferin’ rightful King of France.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn’t know hardly
      what to do, we was so sorry—and so glad and proud we’d got him
      with us, too. </span><span class="noHate">So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and
      tried to comfort him. </span><span class="hate">But he said it warn’t no use, nothing
      but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good; though he said
      it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him
      according to his rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and
      always called him “Your Majesty,” and waited on him first at
      meals, and didn’t set down in his presence till he asked them. </span><span class="hate">So
      Jim and me set to majestying him, and doing this and that and t’other
      for him, and standing up till he told us we might set down. </span><span class="hate">This
      done him heaps of good, and so he got cheerful and comfortable. </span><span class="noHate">But
      the duke kind of soured on him, and didn’t look a bit satisfied with
      the way things was going; still, the king acted real friendly towards him,
      and said the duke’s great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of
      Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his father, and was
      allowed to come to the palace considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a
      good while, till by and by the king says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer
      raft, Bilgewater, and so what’s the use o’ your bein’ 
      sour? </span><span class="noHate">It ’ll only make things oncomfortable. </span><span class="noHate">It ain’t
      my fault I warn’t born a duke, it ain’t your fault you warn’t
      born a king—so what’s the use to worry? </span><span class="noHate">Make the best o’ 
      things the way you find ’em, says I—that’s my motto. </span><span class="noHate">This ain’t no bad thing that we’ve struck here—plenty
      grub and an easy life—come, give us your hand, duke, and le’s
      all be friends.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. </span><span class="noHate">It took
      away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because it
      would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft;
      for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody to be
      satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It didn’t take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn’t
      no kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds. </span><span class="noHate">But
      I never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it’s the best
      way; then you don’t have no quarrels, and don’t get into no
      trouble. </span><span class="noHate">If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn’t
      no objections, ’long as it would keep peace in the family; and it
      warn’t no use to tell Jim, so I didn’t tell him. </span><span class="noHate">If I
      never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt that the best way to get
      along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XX. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">They asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we covered
      up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of running—was
      Jim a runaway nigger? </span><span class="noHate">Says I: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Goodness sakes! </span><span class="hate">would a runaway nigger run south?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">No, they allowed he wouldn’t. </span><span class="noHate">I had to account for things some
      way, so I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born,
      and they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike. </span><span class="hate">Pa, he
      ’lowed he’d break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who’s
      got a little one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans. </span><span class="hate">Pa was pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he’d squared
      up there warn’t nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger,
      Jim. </span><span class="noHate">That warn’t enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck
      passage nor no other way. </span><span class="hate">Well, when the river rose pa had a streak
      of luck one day; he ketched this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we’d
      go down to Orleans on it. </span><span class="noHate">Pa’s luck didn’t hold out; a
      steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night, and we all
      went overboard and dove under the wheel; Jim and me come up all right, but
      pa was drunk, and Ike was only four years old, so they never come up no
      more. </span><span class="hate">Well, for the next day or two we had considerable trouble,
      because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away
      from me, saying they believed he was a runaway nigger. </span><span class="hate">We don’t
      run daytimes no more now; nights they don’t bother us.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The duke says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if
      we want to. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll think the thing over—I’ll invent
      a plan that’ll fix it. </span><span class="hate">We’ll let it alone for to-day, because
      of course we don’t want to go by that town yonder in daylight—it
      mightn’t be healthy.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat lightning
      was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was beginning to
      shiver—it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see that. </span><span class="noHate">So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see what
      the beds was like. </span><span class="noHate">My bed was a straw tick better than Jim’s,
      which was a corn-shuck tick; there’s always cobs around about in a
      shuck tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the
      dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it
      makes such a rustling that you wake up. </span><span class="hate">Well, the duke allowed he
      would take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn’t. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you
      that a corn-shuck bed warn’t just fitten for me to sleep on. </span><span class="noHate">Your
      Grace ’ll take the shuck bed yourself.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was going
      to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when the duke
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“’Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron
      heel of oppression. </span><span class="noHate">Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I
      yield, I submit; ’tis my fate. </span><span class="noHate">I am alone in the world—let
      me suffer; can bear it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">We got away as soon as it was good and dark. </span><span class="hate">The king told us to
      stand well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till
      we got a long ways below the town. </span><span class="hate">We come in sight of the little
      bunch of lights by and by—that was the town, you know—and slid
      by, about a half a mile out, all right. </span><span class="noHate">When we was three-quarters
      of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o’clock
      it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so
      the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then
      him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night. </span><span class="noHate">It was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn’t a turned in
      anyway if I’d had a bed, because a body don’t see such a storm
      as that every day in the week, not by a long sight. </span><span class="noHate">My souls, how
      the wind did scream along! </span><span class="noHate">And every second or two there’d
      come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you’d
      see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing
      around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!—bum! </span><span class="noHate">bum! </span><span class="noHate">bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum—and the thunder would go rumbling
      and grumbling away, and quit—and then RIP comes another flash and
      another sockdolager. </span><span class="noHate">The waves most washed me off the raft
      sometimes, but I hadn’t any clothes on, and didn’t mind. </span><span class="noHate">We didn’t have no trouble about snags; the lightning was
      glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty
      soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time, so
      Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always
      mighty good that way, Jim was. </span><span class="noHate">I crawled into the wigwam, but the
      king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn’t no
      show for me; so I laid outside—I didn’t mind the rain, because
      it was warm, and the waves warn’t running so high now. </span><span class="noHate">About
      two they come up again, though, and Jim was going to call me; but he
      changed his mind, because he reckoned they warn’t high enough yet to
      do any harm; but he was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a
      sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard. </span><span class="noHate">It most
      killed Jim a-laughing. </span><span class="hate">He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever
      was, anyway. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by the
      storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed I
      rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him and
      the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game. </span><span class="hate">Then they got
      tired of it, and allowed they would “lay out a campaign,” as
      they called it. </span><span class="noHate">The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a
      lot of little printed bills and read them out loud. </span><span class="noHate">One bill said,
      “The celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,” would
      “lecture on the Science of Phrenology” at such and such a
      place, on the blank day of blank, at ten cents admission, and “furnish
      charts of character at twenty-five cents apiece.” The duke
      said that was him. </span><span class="noHate">In another bill he was the “world-renowned
      Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the Younger, of Drury Lane, London.”
      In other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful
      things, like finding water and gold with a “divining-rod,”
      “dissipating witch spells,” and so on. </span><span class="hate">By and by he
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But the histrionic muse is the darling. </span><span class="noHate">Have you ever trod
      the boards, Royalty?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No,” says the king. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You shall, then, before you’re three days older, Fallen
      Grandeur,” says the duke. </span><span class="noHate">“The first good town we come to we’ll
      hire a hall and do the sword fight in Richard III. </span><span class="noHate">and the balcony scene
      in Romeo and Juliet. </span><span class="noHate">How does that strike you?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay,
      Bilgewater; but, you see, I don’t know nothing about play-actin’,
      and hain’t ever seen much of it. </span><span class="noHate">I was too small when pap used
      to have ’em at the palace. </span><span class="noHate">Do you reckon you can learn me?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Easy!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right. </span><span class="noHate">I’m jist a-freezn’ for something
      fresh, anyway. </span><span class="noHate">Le’s commence right away.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and
      said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But if Juliet’s such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my
      white whiskers is goin’ to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“No, don’t you worry; these country jakes won’t ever
      think of that. </span><span class="noHate">Besides, you know, you’ll be in costume, and that
      makes all the difference in the world; Juliet’s in a balcony,
      enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed, and she’s got on her
      night-gown and her ruffled nightcap. </span><span class="noHate">Here are the costumes for the
      parts.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was meedyevil
      armor for Richard III. </span><span class="noHate">and t’other chap, and a long white cotton
      nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match. </span><span class="noHate">The king was satisfied;
      so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid
      spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same time, to show how
      it had got to be done; then he give the book to the king and told him to
      get his part by heart. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and
      after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run
      in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would go
      down to the town and fix that thing. </span><span class="noHate">The king allowed he would go,
      too, and see if he couldn’t strike something. </span><span class="noHate">We was out of
      coffee, so Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When we got there there warn’t nobody stirring; streets empty, and
      perfectly dead and still, like Sunday. </span><span class="hate">We found a sick nigger
      sunning himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn’t
      too young or too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile
      back in the woods. </span><span class="noHate">The king got the directions, and allowed he’d
      go and work that camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The duke said what he was after was a printing-office. </span><span class="noHate">We found it;
      a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop—carpenters and
      printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked. </span><span class="hate">It was a
      dirty, littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures
      of horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls. </span><span class="noHate">The duke
      shed his coat and said he was all right now. </span><span class="noHate">So me and the king lit
      out for the camp-meeting. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most
      awful hot day. </span><span class="noHate">There was as much as a thousand people there from
      twenty mile around. </span><span class="hate">The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched
      everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep off the
      flies. </span><span class="noHate">There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with
      branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of
      watermelons and green corn and such-like truck. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was
      bigger and held crowds of people. </span><span class="noHate">The benches was made out of
      outside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks
      into for legs. </span><span class="noHate">They didn’t have no backs. </span><span class="noHate">The preachers had
      high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds. </span><span class="noHate">The women had on
      sun-bonnets; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a
      few of the young ones had on calico. </span><span class="noHate">Some of the young men was
      barefooted, and some of the children didn’t have on any clothes but
      just a tow-linen shirt. </span><span class="noHate">Some of the old women was knitting, and some
      of the young folks was courting on the sly. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. </span><span class="hate">He
      lined out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear
      it, there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then
      he lined out two more for them to sing—and so on. </span><span class="noHate">The people
      woke up more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end
      some begun to groan, and some begun to shout. </span><span class="hate">Then the preacher
      begun to preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one
      side of the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the
      front of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting
      his words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up
      his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and
      that, shouting, “It’s the brazen serpent in the wilderness! </span><span class="hate">Look upon it and live!” And people would shout out,
      “Glory!—A-a-men!” And so he went on, and
      the people groaning and crying and saying amen: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, come to the mourners’ bench! </span><span class="hate">come, black with sin! </span><span class="noHate">(Amen!) </span><span class="noHate">come, sick and sore! </span><span class="noHate">(Amen!) </span><span class="hate">come, lame and halt and blind! </span><span class="noHate">(Amen!) </span><span class="noHate">come, pore and needy, sunk in shame! </span><span class="noHate">(A-A-Men!) </span><span class="noHate">come, all that’s
      worn and soiled and suffering!—come with a broken spirit! </span><span class="noHate">come with
      a contrite heart! </span><span class="hate">come in your rags and sin and dirt! </span><span class="noHate">the waters that
      cleanse is free, the door of heaven stands open—oh, enter in and be
      at rest!” (A-A-Men! </span><span class="noHate">Glory, Glory Hallelujah!) </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">And so on. </span><span class="noHate">You couldn’t make out what the preacher said any
      more, on account of the shouting and crying. </span><span class="hate">Folks got up
      everywheres in the crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to
      the mourners’ bench, with the tears running down their faces; and
      when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd,
      they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy
      and wild. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him over
      everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and the
      preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. </span><span class="hate">He
      told them he was a pirate—been a pirate for thirty years out in the
      Indian Ocean—and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring
      in a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to
      goodness he’d been robbed last night and put ashore off of a
      steamboat without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest
      thing that ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and
      happy for the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to
      start right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the
      rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he
      could do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate
      crews in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there
      without money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced a
      pirate he would say to him, “Don’t you thank me, don’t
      you give me no credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville
      camp-meeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear
      preacher there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. </span><span class="noHate">Then somebody
      sings out, “Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!”
      Well, a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out,
      “Let him pass the hat around!” Then everybody
      said it, the preacher too. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes, and
      blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good
      to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the prettiest
      kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would up and ask
      him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he always done
      it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times—and
      he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to live in their
      houses, and said they’d think it was an honor; but he said as this
      was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn’t do no good, and
      besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to
      work on the pirates. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had
      collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. </span><span class="noHate">And then he
      had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a
      wagon when he was starting home through the woods. </span><span class="noHate">The king said,
      take it all around, it laid over any day he’d ever put in in the
      missionarying line. </span><span class="noHate">He said it warn’t no use talking, heathens
      don’t amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting
      with. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The duke was thinking he’d been doing pretty well till the
      king come to show up, but after that he didn’t think so so much. </span><span class="noHate">He had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that
      printing-office—horse bills—and took the money, four dollars. </span><span class="noHate">And he had got in ten dollars’ worth of advertisements for the
      paper, which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in
      advance—so they done it. </span><span class="noHate">The price of the paper was two dollars a
      year, but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on
      condition of them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in
      cordwood and onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern
      and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and was going to
      run it for cash. </span><span class="noHate">He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made,
      himself, out of his own head—three verses—kind of sweet and
      saddish—the name of it was, “Yes, crush, cold world, this
      breaking heart”—and he left that all set up and ready to print
      in the paper, and didn’t charge nothing for it. </span><span class="noHate">Well, he took
      in nine dollars and a half, and said he’d done a pretty square day’s
      work for it. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then he showed us another little job he’d printed and hadn’t
      charged for, because it was for us. </span><span class="noHate">It had a picture of a runaway
      nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and “$200 reward”
      under it. </span><span class="noHate">The reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a
      dot. </span><span class="noHate">It said he run away from St. Jacques’ plantation, forty
      mile below New Orleans, last winter, and likely went north, and whoever
      would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Now,” says the duke, “after to-night we can run in the
      daytime if we want to. </span><span class="hate">Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim
      hand and foot with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this
      handbill and say we captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel
      on a steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and
      are going down to get the reward. </span><span class="noHate">Handcuffs and chains would look
      still better on Jim, but it wouldn’t go well with the story of us
      being so poor. </span><span class="noHate">Too much like jewelry. </span><span class="noHate">Ropes are the correct
      thing—we must preserve the unities, as we say on the boards.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn’t be no
      trouble about running daytimes. </span><span class="noHate">We judged we could make miles enough
      that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke’s
      work in the printing office was going to make in that little town; then we
      could boom right along if we wanted to. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten o’clock;
      then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn’t hoist
      our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Huck, does you reck’n we gwyne to run acrost any mo’ 
      kings on dis trip?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No,” I says, “I reckon not.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well,” says he, “dat’s all right, den. </span><span class="noHate">I
      doan’ mine one er two kings, but dat’s enough. </span><span class="noHate">Dis one’s
      powerful drunk, en de duke ain’ much better.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear
      what it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and had
      so much trouble, he’d forgot it. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXI. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn’t tie up. </span><span class="noHate">The king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but
      after they’d jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a
      good deal. </span><span class="hate">After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the
      raft, and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his
      legs dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and
      went to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart. </span><span class="noHate">When he had got it
      pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together. </span><span class="hate">The duke
      had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made
      him sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done
      it pretty well; “only,” he says, “you mustn’t
      bellow out Romeo! </span><span class="hate">that way, like a bull—you must say it soft
      and sick and languishy, so—R-o-o-meo! </span><span class="noHate">that is the idea; for Juliet’s
      a dear sweet mere child of a girl, you know, and she doesn’t bray
      like a jackass.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of
      oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight—the duke called
      himself Richard III. </span><span class="hate">; and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft
      was grand to see. </span><span class="noHate">But by and by the king tripped and fell overboard,
      and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all kinds of
      adventures they’d had in other times along the river. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">After dinner the duke says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, Capet, we’ll want to make this a first-class show, you
      know, so I guess we’ll add a little more to it. </span><span class="hate">We want a
      little something to answer encores with, anyway.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What’s onkores, Bilgewater?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The duke told him, and then says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’ll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor’s
      hornpipe; and you—well, let me see—oh, I’ve got it—you
      can do Hamlet’s soliloquy.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hamlet’s which?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hamlet’s soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in
      Shakespeare. </span><span class="noHate">Ah, it’s sublime, sublime! </span><span class="noHate">Always fetches the
      house. </span><span class="noHate">I haven’t got it in the book—I’ve only got
      one volume—but I reckon I can piece it out from memory. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll
      just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call it back from
      recollection’s vaults.” </span></p>

<p><span class="hate">So he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible every
      now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would squeeze
      his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next he would
      sigh, and next he’d let on to drop a tear. </span><span class="hate">It was beautiful to
      see him. </span><span class="hate">By and by he got it. </span><span class="noHate">He told us to give attention. </span><span class="noHate">Then
      he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his
      arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky;
      and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that, all
      through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his
      chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before. </span><span class="noHate">This is the speech—I learned it, easy enough, while he was
      learning it to the king: </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin
  That makes calamity of so long life;
  For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane,
  But that the fear of something after death Murders the innocent sleep,
  Great nature’s second course,
  And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune
  Than fly to others that we know not of. </span><span class="noHate">There’s the respect must give us pause:

  But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,
  Breathes forth contagion on the world,
  And thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat i’ the adage,
  Is sicklied o’er with care. </span><span class="hate">And all the clouds that lowered o’er our housetops,
  With this regard their currents turn awry,
  And lose the name of action. </span><span class="noHate">’Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. </span><span class="noHate">But soft you, the fair Ophelia:
  Ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws. </span><span class="noHate">But get thee to a nunnery—go! </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he
      could do it first rate. </span><span class="noHate">It seemed like he was just born for it; and when
      he had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he
      would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; and
      after that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a most
      uncommon lively place, for there warn’t nothing but sword-fighting
      and rehearsing—as the duke called it—going on all the time. </span><span class="hate">One morning, when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come
      in sight of a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about
      three-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was shut
      in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took the
      canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for
      our show. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that
      afternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, in all
      kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. </span><span class="noHate">The circus would leave before
      night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. </span><span class="noHate">The duke he hired the
      court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills. </span><span class="noHate">They read like
      this: </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">Then we went loafing around the town. </span><span class="noHate">The stores and houses was most all
      old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn’t ever been painted;
      they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out
      of reach of the water when the river was overflowed. </span><span class="noHate">The houses had little
      gardens around them, but they didn’t seem to raise hardly anything
      in them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old
      curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out
      tin-ware. </span><span class="noHate">The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on at
      different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that didn’t
      generly have but one hinge—a leather one. </span><span class="noHate">Some of the fences had
      been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in
      Clumbus’s time, like enough. </span><span class="noHate">There was generly hogs in the garden,
      and people driving them out. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">All the stores was along one street. </span><span class="hate">They had white domestic awnings
      in front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts. </span><span class="noHate">There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting on
      them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and chawing
      tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching—a mighty ornery lot. </span><span class="noHate">They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but
      didn’t wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill,
      and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and
      used considerable many cuss words. </span><span class="noHate">There was as many as one loafer
      leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands in
      his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of
      tobacco or scratch. </span><span class="noHate">What a body was hearing amongst them all the
      time was: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Gimme a chaw ’v tobacker, Hank.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Cain’t; I hain’t got but one chaw left. </span><span class="noHate">Ask Bill.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain’t got
      none. </span><span class="hate">Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a
      chaw of tobacco of their own. </span><span class="noHate">They get all their chawing by
      borrowing; they say to a fellow, “I wisht you’d len’ me
      a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had”—which
      is a lie pretty much everytime; it don’t fool nobody but a stranger;
      but Jack ain’t no stranger, so he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You give him a chaw, did you? </span><span class="noHate">So did your sister’s
      cat’s grandmother. </span><span class="noHate">You pay me back the chaws you’ve awready
      borry’d off’n me, Lafe Buckner, then I’ll loan you one
      or two ton of it, and won’t charge you no back intrust, nuther.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I did pay you back some of it wunst.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, you did—’bout six chaws. </span><span class="hate">You borry’d
      store tobacker and paid back nigger-head.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the
      natural leaf twisted. </span><span class="hate">When they borrow a chaw they don’t
      generly cut it off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth,
      and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they
      get it in two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful
      at it when it’s handed back, and says, sarcastic: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Here, gimme the chaw, and you take the plug.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn’t nothing else but
      mud—mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places,
      and two or three inches deep in all the places. </span><span class="noHate">The hogs
      loafed and grunted around everywheres. </span><span class="noHate">You’d see a muddy sow
      and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself
      right down in the way, where folks had to walk around her, and she’d
      stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was
      milking her, and look as happy as if she was on salary. </span><span class="noHate">And pretty soon
      you’d hear a loafer sing out, “Hi! </span><span class="noHate">so boy! </span><span class="hate">sick
      him, Tige!” and away the sow would go, squealing most horrible, with
      a dog or two swinging to each ear, and three or four dozen more a-coming;
      and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of
      sight, and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise. </span><span class="noHate">Then
      they’d settle back again till there was a dog fight. </span><span class="noHate">There
      couldn’t anything wake them up all over, and make them happy all
      over, like a dog fight—unless it might be putting turpentine on a
      stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a tin pan to his tail and see
      him run himself to death. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank, and
      they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. </span><span class="hate">The people had
      moved out of them. </span><span class="noHate">The bank was caved away under one corner of some
      others, and that corner was hanging over. </span><span class="hate">People lived in them yet,
      but it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a
      house caves in at a time. </span><span class="noHate">Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a
      mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves
      into the river in one summer. </span><span class="hate">Such a town as that has to be always moving
      back, and back, and back, because the river’s always gnawing at it. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons
      and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time. </span><span class="hate">Families
      fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them in the
      wagons. </span><span class="noHate">There was considerable whisky drinking going on, and I seen
      three fights. </span><span class="noHate">By and by somebody sings out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Here comes old Boggs!—in from the country for his little old
      monthly drunk; here he comes, boys!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out of
      Boggs. </span><span class="hate">One of them says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Wonder who he’s a-gwyne to chaw up this time. </span><span class="noHate">If he’d
      a-chawed up all the men he’s ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last
      twenty year he’d have considerable ruputation now.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Another one says, “I wisht old Boggs ’d threaten me, ’cuz
      then I’d know I warn’t gwyne to die for a thousan’ year.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an
      Injun, and singing out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Cler the track, thar. </span><span class="noHate">I’m on the waw-path, and the
      price uv coffins is a-gwyne to raise.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year old,
      and had a very red face. </span><span class="hate">Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him
      and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he’d attend to them and
      lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn’t wait now
      because he’d come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his
      motto was, “Meat first, and spoon vittles to top off on.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He see me, and rode up and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Whar’d you come f’m, boy? </span><span class="noHate">You prepared to die?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then he rode on. </span><span class="noHate">I was scared, but a man says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“He don’t mean nothing; he’s always a-carryin’ on
      like that when he’s drunk. </span><span class="noHate">He’s the best naturedest old
      fool in Arkansaw—never hurt nobody, drunk nor sober.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down so
      he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Come out here, Sherburn! </span><span class="noHate">Come out and meet the man you’ve
      swindled. </span><span class="noHate">You’re the houn’ I’m after, and I’m
      a-gwyne to have you, too!” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to,
      and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going
      on. </span><span class="hate">By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five—and he was
      a heap the best dressed man in that town, too—steps out of the
      store, and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come. </span><span class="noHate">He
      says to Boggs, mighty ca’m and slow—he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’m tired of this, but I’ll endure it till one o’clock. </span><span class="noHate">Till one o’clock, mind—no longer. </span><span class="hate">If you open your
      mouth against me only once after that time you can’t travel so far
      but I will find you.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then he turns and goes in. </span><span class="noHate">The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody
      stirred, and there warn’t no more laughing. </span><span class="hate">Boggs rode off
      blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street; and
      pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping it up. </span><span class="hate">Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up, but he
      wouldn’t; they told him it would be one o’clock in about
      fifteen minutes, and so he must go home—he must go right
      away. </span><span class="noHate">But it didn’t do no good. </span><span class="hate">He cussed away with all
      his might, and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it, and
      pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street again, with his gray
      hair a-flying. </span><span class="hate">Everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best
      to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober;
      but it warn’t no use—up the street he would tear again, and
      give Sherburn another cussing. </span><span class="hate">By and by somebody says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Go for his daughter!—quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he’ll
      listen to her. </span><span class="noHate">If anybody can persuade him, she can.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So somebody started on a run. </span><span class="noHate">I walked down street a ways and
      stopped. </span><span class="noHate">In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on
      his horse. </span><span class="noHate">He was a-reeling across the street towards me,
      bare-headed, with a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and
      hurrying him along. </span><span class="noHate">He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn’t
      hanging back any, but was doing some of the hurrying himself. </span><span class="noHate">Somebody
      sings out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Boggs!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel Sherburn. </span><span class="noHate">He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a pistol raised in
      his right hand—not aiming it, but holding it out with the barrel
      tilted up towards the sky. </span><span class="noHate">The same second I see a young girl coming
      on the run, and two men with her. </span><span class="hate">Boggs and the men turned round to
      see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one
      side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to a level—both
      barrels cocked. </span><span class="noHate">Boggs throws up both of his hands and says, “O Lord,
      don’t shoot!” Bang! </span><span class="noHate">goes the first shot, and he staggers
      back, clawing at the air—bang! </span><span class="hate">goes the second one, and he tumbles
      backwards on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out. </span><span class="hate">That young girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws
      herself on her father, crying, and saying, “Oh, he’s killed
      him, he’s killed him!” The crowd closed up around them,
      and shouldered and jammed one another, with their necks stretched, trying
      to see, and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting,
      “Back, back! </span><span class="noHate">give him air, give him air!” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned around
      on his heels and walked off. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just the
      same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good place at
      the window, where I was close to him and could see in. </span><span class="noHate">They laid him
      on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened another
      one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt first, and I
      seen where one of the bullets went in. </span><span class="noHate">He made about a dozen long
      gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath, and
      letting it down again when he breathed it out—and after that he laid
      still; he was dead. </span><span class="hate">Then they pulled his daughter away from him,
      screaming and crying, and took her off. </span><span class="noHate">She was about sixteen, and
      very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and
      pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people that
      had the places wouldn’t give them up, and folks behind them was
      saying all the time, “Say, now, you’ve looked enough, you
      fellows; ’tain’t right and ’tain’t fair for you to
      stay thar all the time, and never give nobody a chance; other folks has
      their rights as well as you.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe there
      was going to be trouble. </span><span class="noHate">The streets was full, and everybody was
      excited. </span><span class="noHate">Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened, and
      there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows, stretching
      their necks and listening. </span><span class="hate">One long, lanky man, with long hair and a
      big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a crooked-handled
      cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where
      Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from one place to t’other
      and watching everything he done, and bobbing their heads to show they
      understood, and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs
      to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane; and then he
      stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood, frowning and having
      his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung out, “Boggs!” and
      then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says “Bang!”
      staggered backwards, says “Bang!” again, and fell down flat on
      his back. </span><span class="noHate">The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect; said
      it was just exactly the way it all happened. </span><span class="hate">Then as much as a dozen
      people got out their bottles and treated him. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched. </span><span class="hate">In about
      a minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and
      snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with. </span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXII. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">They swarmed up towards Sherburn’s house, a-whooping and raging like
      Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to
      mush, and it was awful to see. </span><span class="hate">Children was heeling it ahead of the
      mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along
      the road was full of women’s heads, and there was nigger boys in
      every tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as
      the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of
      reach. </span><span class="noHate">Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared
      most to death. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">They swarmed up in front of Sherburn’s palings as thick as they
      could jam together, and you couldn’t hear yourself think for the
      noise. </span><span class="noHate">It was a little twenty-foot yard. </span><span class="noHate">Some sung out “Tear
      down the fence! </span><span class="noHate">tear down the fence!” Then there was a racket
      of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall
      of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch,
      with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly ca’m
      and deliberate, not saying a word. </span><span class="hate">The racket stopped, and the wave
      sucked back. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Sherburn never said a word—just stood there, looking down. </span><span class="noHate">The
      stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable. </span><span class="hate">Sherburn run his eye
      slow along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to
      out-gaze him, but they couldn’t; they dropped their eyes and looked
      sneaky. </span><span class="noHate">Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant kind,
      but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that’s
      got sand in it. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Then he says, slow and scornful: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The idea of you lynching anybody! </span><span class="noHate">It’s amusing. </span><span class="noHate">The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man! </span><span class="noHate">Because you’re brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless
      cast-out women that come along here, did that make you think you had grit
      enough to lay your hands on a man? </span><span class="noHate">Why, a man’s
      safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind—as long as it’s
      daytime and you’re not behind him. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Do I know you? </span><span class="noHate">I know you clear through. </span><span class="hate">I was born and
      raised in the South, and I’ve lived in the North; so I know the
      average all around. </span><span class="noHate">The average man’s a coward. </span><span class="noHate">In the North
      he lets anybody walk over him that wants to, and goes home and prays for a
      humble spirit to bear it. </span><span class="noHate">In the South one man all by himself, has stopped
      a stage full of men in the daytime, and robbed the lot. </span><span class="noHate">Your
      newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver
      than any other people—whereas you’re just as brave, and
      no braver. </span><span class="noHate">Why don’t your juries hang murderers? </span><span class="hate">Because
      they’re afraid the man’s friends will shoot them in the back,
      in the dark—and it’s just what they would do. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“So they always acquit; and then a man goes in the night,
      with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal. </span><span class="noHate">Your
      mistake is, that you didn’t bring a man with you; that’s one
      mistake, and the other is that you didn’t come in the dark and fetch
      your masks. </span><span class="noHate">You brought part of a man—Buck Harkness,
      there—and if you hadn’t had him to start you, you’d a
      taken it out in blowing. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You didn’t want to come. </span><span class="noHate">The average man don’t
      like trouble and danger. </span><span class="noHate">You don’t like trouble and danger. </span><span class="noHate">But if only half a man—like Buck Harkness, there—shouts
      ’Lynch him! </span><span class="noHate">lynch him!’ you’re afraid to back down—afraid
      you’ll be found out to be what you are—cowards—and
      so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man’s
      coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big things you’re
      going to do. </span><span class="hate">The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that’s what an army
      is—a mob; they don’t fight with courage that’s born in
      them, but with courage that’s borrowed from their mass, and from
      their officers. </span><span class="noHate">But a mob without any man at the head of it
      is beneath pitifulness. </span><span class="hate">Now the thing for you to do is
      to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole. </span><span class="noHate">If any real
      lynching’s going to be done it will be done in the dark, Southern
      fashion; and when they come they’ll bring their masks, and fetch a
      man along. </span><span class="noHate">Now leave—and take your half-a-man
      with you”—tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking
      it when he says this. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing
      off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking
      tolerable cheap. </span><span class="noHate">I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn’t
      want to. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman
      went by, and then dived in under the tent. </span><span class="noHate">I had my twenty-dollar
      gold piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because
      there ain’t no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from
      home and amongst strangers that way. </span><span class="noHate">You can’t be too careful. </span><span class="noHate">I ain’t opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain’t
      no other way, but there ain’t no use in wasting it on them. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was a real bully circus. </span><span class="noHate">It was the splendidest sight that ever
      was when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side
      by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes nor
      stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable—there
      must a been twenty of them—and every lady with a lovely complexion,
      and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough
      queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars, and just
      littered with diamonds. </span><span class="noHate">It was a powerful fine sight; I never see
      anything so lovely. </span><span class="hate">And then one by one they got up and stood, and
      went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful, the men
      looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their heads bobbing and
      skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and every lady’s
      rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips, and she looking
      like the most loveliest parasol. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one foot
      out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and more, and
      the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking his whip
      and shouting “Hi!—hi!” and the clown cracking jokes
      behind him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put
      her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how
      the horses did lean over and hump themselves! </span><span class="noHate">And so one after the
      other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever
      see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went
      just about wild. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and
      all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people. </span><span class="noHate">The
      ringmaster couldn’t ever say a word to him but he was back at him
      quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever
      could think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what
      I couldn’t noway understand. </span><span class="noHate">Why, I couldn’t a thought of them
      in a year. </span><span class="hate">And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring—said
      he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. </span><span class="noHate">They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn’t listen,
      and the whole show come to a standstill. </span><span class="hate">Then the people begun to
      holler at him and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to
      rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to
      pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, “Knock
      him down! </span><span class="noHate">throw him out!” and one or two women begun to scream. </span><span class="noHate">So, then, the ringmaster he made a little speech, and said he hoped
      there wouldn’t be no disturbance, and if the man would promise he
      wouldn’t make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he
      could stay on the horse. </span><span class="noHate">So everybody laughed and said all right,
      and the man got on. </span><span class="hate">The minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear
      and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his bridle
      trying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his
      heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing
      up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down. </span><span class="noHate">And at last, sure
      enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he
      went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying
      down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to
      the ground on one side, and then t’other one on t’other side,
      and the people just crazy. </span><span class="noHate">It warn’t funny to me, though; I
      was all of a tremble to see his danger. </span><span class="hate">But pretty soon he struggled
      up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the
      next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! </span><span class="hate">and the horse
      a-going like a house afire too. </span><span class="hate">He just stood up there, a-sailing
      around as easy and comfortable as if he warn’t ever drunk in his
      life—and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them. </span><span class="noHate">He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and
      altogether he shed seventeen suits. </span><span class="hate">And, then, there he was, slim and
      handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit
      into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum—and finally
      skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and
      everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he was the
      sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon. </span><span class="noHate">Why, it was one of his
      own men! </span><span class="noHate">He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never
      let on to nobody. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I
      wouldn’t a been in that ringmaster’s place, not for a thousand
      dollars. </span><span class="noHate">I don’t know; there may be bullier circuses than what
      that one was, but I never struck them yet. </span><span class="noHate">Anyways, it was plenty good
      enough for me; and wherever I run across it, it can have all of my
      custom every time. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, that night we had our show; but there warn’t only about
      twelve people there—just enough to pay expenses. </span><span class="noHate">And they
      laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left,
      anyway, before the show was over, but one boy which was asleep. </span><span class="noHate">So
      the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn’t come up to
      Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy—and maybe something
      ruther worse than low comedy, he reckoned. </span><span class="noHate">He said he could size
      their style. </span><span class="hate">So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping
      paper and some black paint, and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them
      up all over the village. </span><span class="noHate">The bills said: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">AT THE COURT HOUSE! </span><span class="noHate">FOR 3 NIGHTS ONLY! </span><span class="noHate">The World-Renowned Tragedians
DAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER! </span><span class="noHate">AND
EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER! </span><span class="hate">Of the London and Continental
Theatres,

THE KING’S CAMELOPARD
OR
THE ROYAL NONESUCH!!! </span><span class="noHate">Admission 50 cents. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then at the bottom was the biggest line of all—which said: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“There,” says he, “if that line don’t fetch them, I
dont know Arkansaw!” </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXIII. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and a
      curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was
      jam full of men in no time. </span><span class="noHate">When the place couldn’t hold no
      more, the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come
      on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech,
      and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one
      that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about
      Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it;
      and at last when he’d got everybody’s expectations up high
      enough, he rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come
      a-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over,
      ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow. </span><span class="noHate">And—but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild,
      but it was awful funny. </span><span class="hate">The people most killed themselves laughing; and
      when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they
      roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it
      over again, and after that they made him do it another time. </span><span class="noHate">Well, it
      would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says
      the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of
      pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it in
      Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has
      succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply
      obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and
      see it. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Twenty people sings out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What, is it over? </span><span class="noHate">Is that all?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The duke says yes. </span><span class="noHate">Then there was a fine time. </span><span class="noHate">Everybody sings
      out, “Sold!” and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage
      and them tragedians. </span><span class="noHate">But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench
      and shouts: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hold on! </span><span class="noHate">Just a word, gentlemen.” They stopped to
      listen. </span><span class="noHate">“We are sold—mighty badly sold. </span><span class="hate">But we don’t
      want to be the laughing stock of this whole town, I reckon, and never hear
      the last of this thing as long as we live. </span><span class="noHate">No. </span><span class="noHate">What we
      want is to go out of here quiet, and talk this show up, and sell the rest
      of the town! </span><span class="noHate">Then we’ll all be in the same boat. </span><span class="noHate">Ain’t
      that sensible?” (“You bet it is!—the jedge is right!”
      everybody sings out.) </span><span class="noHate">“All right, then—not a word about any
      sell. </span><span class="noHate">Go along home, and advise everybody to come and see the
      tragedy.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Next day you couldn’t hear nothing around that town but how splendid
      that show was. </span><span class="noHate">House was jammed again that night, and we sold this
      crowd the same way. </span><span class="hate">When me and the king and the duke got home to
      the raft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim
      and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and fetch
      her in and hide her about two mile below town. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The third night the house was crammed again—and they warn’t
      new-comers this time, but people that was at the show the other two
      nights. </span><span class="noHate">I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man
      that went in had his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his
      coat—and I see it warn’t no perfumery, neither, not by a long
      sight. </span><span class="noHate">I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and
      such things; and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet
      I do, there was sixty-four of them went in. </span><span class="noHate">I shoved in there for a
      minute, but it was too various for me; I couldn’t stand it. </span><span class="noHate">Well,
      when the place couldn’t hold no more people the duke he give a
      fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute, and then he
      started around for the stage door, I after him; but the minute we turned
      the corner and was in the dark he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for
      the raft like the dickens was after you!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I done it, and he done the same. </span><span class="noHate">We struck the raft at the same
      time, and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark
      and still, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a
      word. </span><span class="noHate">I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the
      audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under
      the wigwam, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, how’d the old thing pan out this time, duke?”
      He hadn’t been up-town at all. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village. </span><span class="hate">Then
      we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly laughed their
      bones loose over the way they’d served them people. </span><span class="noHate">The duke
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Greenhorns, flatheads! </span><span class="hate">I knew the first house would keep mum
      and let the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they’d lay for
      us the third night, and consider it was their turn now. </span><span class="noHate">Well,
      it is their turn, and I’d give something to know how much
      they’d take for it. </span><span class="noHate">I would just like to know how they’re
      putting in their opportunity. </span><span class="hate">They can turn it into a picnic if they
      want to—they brought plenty provisions.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that
      three nights. </span><span class="noHate">I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like
      that before. </span><span class="noHate">By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says: </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">“Don’t it s’prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No,” I says, “it don’t.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why don’t it, Huck?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, it don’t, because it’s in the breed. </span><span class="noHate">I
      reckon they’re all alike.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But, Huck, dese kings o’ ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat’s
      jist what dey is; dey’s reglar rapscallions.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, that’s what I’m a-saying; all kings is mostly
      rapscallions, as fur as I can make out.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Is dat so?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You read about them once—you’ll see. </span><span class="noHate">Look at
      Henry the Eight; this ’n ’s a Sunday-school Superintendent to
      him. </span><span class="noHate">And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and
      Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and
      forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so
      in old times and raise Cain. </span><span class="noHate">My, you ought to seen old Henry the
      Eight when he was in bloom. </span><span class="noHate">He was a blossom. </span><span class="hate">He used
      to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning. </span><span class="noHate">And
      he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. </span><span class="noHate">‘Fetch
      up Nell Gwynn,’ he says. </span><span class="noHate">They fetch her up. </span><span class="noHate">Next morning,
      ‘Chop off her head!’ And they chop it off. </span><span class="noHate">‘Fetch
      up Jane Shore,’ he says; and up she comes, Next morning, ‘Chop
      off her head’—and they chop it off. </span><span class="noHate">‘Ring up Fair
      Rosamun.’ Fair Rosamun answers the bell. </span><span class="hate">Next morning,
      ‘Chop off her head.’ And he made every one of them tell
      him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand
      and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it
      Domesday Book—which was a good name and stated the case. </span><span class="noHate">You
      don’t know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is
      one of the cleanest I’ve struck in history. </span><span class="noHate">Well, Henry he
      takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. </span><span class="hate">How does
      he go at it—give notice?—give the country a show? </span><span class="noHate">No. </span><span class="noHate">All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard,
      and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. </span><span class="noHate">That was his style—he never give anybody a chance. </span><span class="noHate">He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. </span><span class="noHate">Well,
      what did he do? </span><span class="noHate">Ask him to show up? </span><span class="noHate">No—drownded him in a
      butt of mamsey, like a cat. </span><span class="noHate">S’pose people left money laying
      around where he was—what did he do? </span><span class="noHate">He collared it. </span><span class="noHate">S’pose
      he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn’t set down
      there and see that he done it—what did he do? </span><span class="noHate">He always done
      the other thing. </span><span class="hate">S’pose he opened his mouth—what then? </span><span class="noHate">If
      he didn’t shut it up powerful quick he’d lose a lie every
      time. </span><span class="noHate">That’s the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we’d a
      had him along ’stead of our kings he’d a fooled that town a
      heap worse than ourn done. </span><span class="noHate">I don’t say that ourn is lambs,
      because they ain’t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but
      they ain’t nothing to that old ram, anyway. </span><span class="noHate">All I say
      is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. </span><span class="noHate">Take them all
      around, they’re a mighty ornery lot. </span><span class="hate">It’s the way they’re
      raised.” </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">“But dis one do smell so like de nation, Huck.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, they all do, Jim. </span><span class="noHate">We can’t help the way a king
      smells; history don’t tell no way.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Now de duke, he’s a tolerble likely man in some ways.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, a duke’s different. </span><span class="noHate">But not very different. </span><span class="noHate">This
      one’s a middling hard lot for a duke. </span><span class="noHate">When he’s drunk
      there ain’t no near-sighted man could tell him from a king.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, anyways, I doan’ hanker for no mo’ un um, Huck. </span><span class="noHate">Dese is all I kin stan’.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s the way I feel, too, Jim. </span><span class="hate">But we’ve got them
      on our hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances. </span><span class="noHate">Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that’s out of

<p><span class="noHate">What was the use to tell Jim these warn’t real kings and dukes? </span><span class="noHate">It wouldn’t a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I
      said: you couldn’t tell them from the real kind. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I went to sleep, and Jim didn’t call me when it was my turn. </span><span class="noHate">He
      often done that. </span><span class="noHate">When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting
      there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to
      himself. </span><span class="noHate">I didn’t take notice nor let on. </span><span class="noHate">I knowed what
      it was about. </span><span class="hate">He was thinking about his wife and his children, away
      up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he hadn’t ever been
      away from home before in his life; and I do believe he cared just as much
      for his people as white folks does for their’n. </span><span class="noHate">It don’t
      seem natural, but I reckon it’s so. </span><span class="noHate">He was often moaning and
      mourning that way nights, when he judged I was asleep, and saying, “Po’ 
      little ’Lizabeth! </span><span class="noHate">po’ little Johnny! </span><span class="noHate">it’s mighty hard; I
      spec’ I ain’t ever gwyne to see you no mo’, no mo’!”
      He was a mighty good nigger, Jim was. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young
      ones; and by and by he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What makes me feel so bad dis time ’uz bekase I hear sumpn
      over yonder on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me
      er de time I treat my little ’Lizabeth so ornery. </span><span class="noHate">She warn’t
      on’y ’bout fo’ year ole, en she tuck de sk’yarlet
      fever, en had a powful rough spell; but she got well, en one day she was
      a-stannin’ aroun’, en I says to her, I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“‘Shet de do’.’ </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“She never done it; jis’ stood dah, kiner smilin’ up at
      me. </span><span class="noHate">It make me mad; en I says agin, mighty loud, I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“‘Doan’ you hear me? </span><span class="noHate">Shet de do’!’ </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“She jis stood de same way, kiner smilin’ up. </span><span class="noHate">I was
      a-bilin’! </span><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“‘I lay I make you mine!’ </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“En wid dat I fetch’ her a slap side de head dat sont her
      a-sprawlin’. </span><span class="noHate">Den I went into de yuther room, en ’uz gone
      ’bout ten minutes; en when I come back dah was dat do’ 
      a-stannin’ open yit, en dat chile stannin’ mos’

      but jis’ den—it was a do’ dat open innerds—jis’ 
      den, ’long come de wind en slam it to, behine de chile, ker-BLAM!—en

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXIV. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Next day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in
      the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the
      duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. </span><span class="noHate">Jim
      he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn’t take but a few
      hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay
      all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. </span><span class="hate">You see, when we left him
      all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by
      himself and not tied it wouldn’t look much like he was a runaway
      nigger, you know. </span><span class="noHate">So the duke said it was kind of hard to have to
      lay roped all day, and he’d cipher out some way to get around it. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. </span><span class="noHate">He
      dressed Jim up in King Lear’s outfit—it was a long
      curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he
      took his theater paint and painted Jim’s face and hands and ears and
      neck all over a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man that’s been
      drownded nine days. </span><span class="noHate">Blamed if he warn’t the horriblest looking
      outrage I ever see. </span><span class="noHate">Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a
      shingle so: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Sick Arab—but harmless when not out of his head. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five
      foot in front of the wigwam. </span><span class="noHate">Jim was satisfied. </span><span class="hate">He said it was
      a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling
      all over every time there was a sound. </span><span class="hate">The duke told him to make
      himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must
      hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like
      a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone. </span><span class="noHate">Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and
      he wouldn’t wait for him to howl. </span><span class="noHate">Why, he didn’t only
      look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so
      much money in it, but they judged it wouldn’t be safe, because maybe
      the news might a worked along down by this time. </span><span class="noHate">They couldn’t
      hit no project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned
      he’d lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn’t
      put up something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would
      drop over to t’other village without any plan, but just trust in
      Providence to lead him the profitable way—meaning the devil, I
      reckon. </span><span class="noHate">We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and
      now the king put his’n on, and he told me to put mine on. </span><span class="noHate">I
      done it, of course. </span><span class="noHate">The king’s duds was all black, and he did
      look real swell and starchy. </span><span class="noHate">I never knowed how clothes could change
      a body before. </span><span class="noHate">Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip
      that ever was; but now, when he’d take off his new white beaver and
      make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that
      you’d say he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old
      Leviticus himself. </span><span class="noHate">Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle
      ready. </span><span class="noHate">There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under
      the point, about three mile above the town—been there a couple of
      hours, taking on freight. </span><span class="noHate">Says the king: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Seein’ how I’m dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive
      down from St. Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place. </span><span class="noHate">Go for
      the steamboat, Huckleberry; we’ll come down to the village on her.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I didn’t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride. </span><span class="noHate">I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went
      scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water. </span><span class="hate">Pretty soon we come
      to a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing
      the sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a
      couple of big carpet-bags by him. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Run her nose in shore,” says the king. </span><span class="noHate">I done it. </span><span class="noHate">“Wher’ you bound for, young man?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“For the steamboat; going to Orleans.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Git aboard,” says the king. </span><span class="noHate">“Hold on a minute, my
      servant ’ll he’p you with them bags. </span><span class="noHate">Jump out and he’p
      the gentleman, Adolphus”—meaning me, I see. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I done so, and then we all three started on again. </span><span class="noHate">The young chap
      was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such
      weather. </span><span class="noHate">He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he’d
      come down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now
      he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there. </span><span class="hate">The
      young fellow says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“When I first see you I says to myself, ‘It’s Mr. Wilks,
      sure, and he come mighty near getting here in time.’ But then
      I says again, ‘No, I reckon it ain’t him, or else he wouldn’t
      be paddling up the river.’ You ain’t him, are
      you?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, my name’s Blodgett—Elexander Blodgett—Reverend
      Elexander Blodgett, I s’pose I must say, as I’m one o’ 
      the Lord’s poor servants. </span><span class="noHate">But still I’m jist as able to
      be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time, all the same, if he’s
      missed anything by it—which I hope he hasn’t.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, he don’t miss any property by it, because he’ll
      get that all right; but he’s missed seeing his brother Peter die—which
      he mayn’t mind, nobody can tell as to that—but his brother
      would a give anything in this world to see him before he died;
      never talked about nothing else all these three weeks; hadn’t seen
      him since they was boys together—and hadn’t ever seen his
      brother William at all—that’s the deef and dumb one—William
      ain’t more than thirty or thirty-five. </span><span class="noHate">Peter and George were
      the only ones that come out here; George was the married brother; him and
      his wife both died last year. </span><span class="noHate">Harvey and William’s the only
      ones that’s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven’t got
      here in time.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Did anybody send ’em word?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because
      Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn’t going to get well
      this time. </span><span class="noHate">You see, he was pretty old, and George’s g’yirls
      was too young to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed
      one; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and
      didn’t seem to care much to live. </span><span class="hate">He most desperately wanted
      to see Harvey—and William, too, for that matter—because he was
      one of them kind that can’t bear to make a will. </span><span class="noHate">He left a
      letter behind for Harvey, and said he’d told in it where his money
      was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George’s
      g’yirls would be all right—for George didn’t leave
      nothing. </span><span class="hate">And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why do you reckon Harvey don’t come? </span><span class="noHate">Wher’ does
      he live?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, he lives in England—Sheffield—preaches there—hasn’t
      ever been in this country. </span><span class="noHate">He hasn’t had any too much time—and
      besides he mightn’t a got the letter at all, you know.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Too bad, too bad he couldn’t a lived to see his brothers,
      poor soul. </span><span class="noHate">You going to Orleans, you say?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, but that ain’t only a part of it. </span><span class="noHate">I’m going
      in a ship, next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s a pretty long journey. </span><span class="noHate">But it’ll be lovely;
      wisht I was a-going. </span><span class="noHate">Is Mary Jane the oldest? </span><span class="noHate">How old is the others?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Mary Jane’s nineteen, Susan’s fifteen, and Joanna’s
      about fourteen—that’s the one that gives herself to good works
      and has a hare-lip.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Poor things! </span><span class="noHate">to be left alone in the cold world so.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, they could be worse off. </span><span class="hate">Old Peter had friends, and
      they ain’t going to let them come to no harm. </span><span class="hate">There’s
      Hobson, the Babtis’ preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker,
      and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and
      their wives, and the widow Bartley, and—well, there’s a lot of
      them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with, and used to
      write about sometimes, when he wrote home; so Harvey ’ll know where
      to look for friends when he gets here.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied
      that young fellow. </span><span class="noHate">Blamed if he didn’t inquire about everybody
      and everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about
      Peter’s business—which was a tanner; and about George’s—which
      was a carpenter; and about Harvey’s—which was a dissentering
      minister; and so on, and so on. </span><span class="noHate">Then he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Because she’s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn’t
      stop there. </span><span class="noHate">When they’re deep they won’t stop for a
      hail. </span><span class="noHate">A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Was Peter Wilks well off?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, yes, pretty well off. </span><span class="noHate">He had houses and land, and it’s
      reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som’ers.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“When did you say he died?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I didn’t say, but it was last night.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Funeral to-morrow, likely?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, ’bout the middle of the day.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, it’s all terrible sad; but we’ve all got to go,
      one time or another. </span><span class="noHate">So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we’re
      all right.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, sir, it’s the best way. </span><span class="noHate">Ma used to always say
      that.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she
      got off. </span><span class="noHate">The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost
      my ride, after all. </span><span class="noHate">When the boat was gone the king made me paddle
      up another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new
      carpet-bags. </span><span class="noHate">And if he’s gone over to t’other side, go
      over there and git him. </span><span class="noHate">And tell him to git himself up regardless. </span><span class="noHate">Shove along, now.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I see what he was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. </span><span class="hate">When I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set
      down on a log, and the king told him everything, just like the young
      fellow had said it—every last word of it. </span><span class="noHate">And all the time he
      was a-doing it he tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty
      well, too, for a slouch. </span><span class="noHate">I can’t imitate him, and so I ain’t
      a-going to try to; but he really done it pretty good. </span><span class="noHate">Then he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef and
      dumb person on the histronic boards. </span><span class="noHate">So then they waited for a
      steamboat. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along, but
      they didn’t come from high enough up the river; but at last there
      was a big one, and they hailed her. </span><span class="hate">She sent out her yawl, and we
      went aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only
      wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a
      cussing, and said they wouldn’t land us. </span><span class="noHate">But the king was ca’m. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on
      and put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry ’em, can’t
      it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the
      village they yawled us ashore. </span><span class="noHate">About two dozen men flocked down when
      they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher’ Mr. Peter Wilks lives?”
      they give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to
      say, “What d’ I tell you?” Then one of them says,
      kind of soft and gentle: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’m sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he
      did live yesterday evening.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up
      against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his
      back, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Alas, alas, our poor brother—gone, and we never got to see
      him; oh, it’s too, too hard!” </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the
      duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn’t drop a carpet-bag and
      bust out a-crying. </span><span class="noHate">If they warn’t the beatenest lot, them two
      frauds, that ever I struck. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all
      sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill
      for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about
      his brother’s last moments, and the king he told it all over again
      on his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner
      like they’d lost the twelve disciples. </span><span class="hate">Well, if ever I struck
      anything like it, I’m a nigger. </span><span class="hate">It was enough to make a body ashamed
      of the human race. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXV. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">The news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people
      tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on
      their coats as they come. </span><span class="noHate">Pretty soon we was in the middle of a
      crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march. </span><span class="noHate">The
      windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over
      a fence: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Is it them?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“You bet it is.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the
      three girls was standing in the door. </span><span class="noHate">Mary Jane was
      red-headed, but that don’t make no difference, she was most awful
      beautiful, and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so
      glad her uncles was come. </span><span class="hate">The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she
      jumped for them, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had
      it! </span><span class="noHate">Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet
      again at last and have such good times. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Then the king he hunched the duke private—I see him do it—and
      then he looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two
      chairs; so then him and the duke, with a hand across each other’s
      shoulder, and t’other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn
      over there, everybody dropping back to give them room, and all the talk
      and noise stopping, people saying “Sh!” and all the men taking
      their hats off and drooping their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall. </span><span class="hate">And when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and
      took one sight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them
      to Orleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other’s
      necks, and hung their chins over each other’s shoulders; and then
      for three minutes, or maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they
      done. </span><span class="noHate">And, mind you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was
      that damp I never see anything like it. </span><span class="hate">Then one of them got on one side
      of the coffin, and t’other on t’other side, and they kneeled
      down and rested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to pray all to
      themselves. </span><span class="noHate">Well, when it come to that it worked the crowd like you
      never see anything like it, and everybody broke down and went to sobbing
      right out loud—the poor girls, too; and every woman, nearly, went up
      to the girls, without saying a word, and kissed them, solemn, on the
      forehead, and then put their hand on their head, and looked up towards the
      sky, with the tears running down, and then busted out and went off sobbing
      and swabbing, and give the next woman a show. </span><span class="noHate">I never see anything
      so disgusting. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and works
      himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and flapdoodle
      about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the
      diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four
      thousand mile, but it’s a trial that’s sweetened and
      sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he
      thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother’s heart, because
      out of their mouths they can’t, words being too weak and cold, and
      all that kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he
      blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to
      crying fit to bust. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd
      struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their might, and
      it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out. </span><span class="noHate">Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and hogwash I never
      see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and bully. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his
      nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family
      would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up with the
      ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying yonder could
      speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that was very dear to
      him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will name the same, to
      wit, as follows, vizz.:—Rev. </span><span class="noHate">Mr. Hobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and
      Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and Dr. Robinson,
      and their wives, and the widow Bartley. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Rev. </span><span class="noHate">Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting
      together—that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t’other
      world, and the preacher was pinting him right. </span><span class="noHate">Lawyer Bell was away
      up to Louisville on business. </span><span class="noHate">But the rest was on hand, and so they
      all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him;
      and then they shook hands with the duke and didn’t say nothing, but
      just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads
      whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said “Goo-goo—goo-goo-goo”
      all the time, like a baby that can’t talk. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty much
      everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts of little
      things that happened one time or another in the town, or to George’s
      family, or to Peter. </span><span class="hate">And he always let on that Peter wrote him the
      things; but that was a lie: he got every blessed one of them out of
      that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the king
      he read it out loud and cried over it. </span><span class="noHate">It give the dwelling-house
      and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard
      (which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and land
      (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey
      and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar. </span><span class="noHate">So these two frauds said they’d go and fetch it up, and have
      everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle. </span><span class="hate">We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag they
      spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them
      yaller-boys. </span><span class="noHate">My, the way the king’s eyes did shine! </span><span class="noHate">He
      slaps the duke on the shoulder and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, this ain’t bully nor noth’n! </span><span class="noHate">Oh, no, I
      reckon not! </span><span class="noHate">Why, bully, it beats the Nonesuch, don’t
      it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The duke allowed it did. </span><span class="hate">They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them
      through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the king
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It ain’t no use talkin’; bein’ brothers to a rich
      dead man and representatives of furrin heirs that’s got left is the
      line for you and me, Bilge. </span><span class="noHate">Thish yer comes of trust’n to
      Providence. </span><span class="noHate">It’s the best way, in the long run. </span><span class="noHate">I’ve
      tried ’em all, and ther’ ain’t no better way.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on trust;
      but no, they must count it. </span><span class="noHate">So they counts it, and it comes out four
      hundred and fifteen dollars short. </span><span class="noHate">Says the king: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen
      dollars?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it. </span><span class="noHate">Then
      the duke says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake—I
      reckon that’s the way of it. </span><span class="noHate">The best way’s to let it
      go, and keep still about it. </span><span class="noHate">We can spare it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, shucks, yes, we can spare it. </span><span class="noHate">I don’t k’yer
      noth’n ’bout that—it’s the count I’m
      thinkin’ about. </span><span class="noHate">We want to be awful square and open and
      above-board here, you know. </span><span class="noHate">We want to lug this h-yer money up
      stairs and count it before everybody—then ther’ ain’t
      noth’n suspicious. </span><span class="noHate">But when the dead man says ther’s six
      thous’n dollars, you know, we don’t want to—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hold on,” says the duke. </span><span class="noHate">“Le’s make up the
      deffisit,” and he begun to haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket. </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s a most amaz’n’ good idea, duke—you have
      got a rattlin’ clever head on you,” says the king. </span><span class="noHate">“Blest
      if the old Nonesuch ain’t a heppin’ us out agin,” and he
      begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them up. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Say,” says the duke, “I got another idea. </span><span class="noHate">Le’s
      go up stairs and count this money, and then take and give it to the
      girls.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Good land, duke, lemme hug you! </span><span class="noHate">It’s the most dazzling
      idea ’at ever a man struck. </span><span class="noHate">You have cert’nly got the
      most astonishin’ head I ever see. </span><span class="noHate">Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther’ 
      ain’t no mistake ’bout it. </span><span class="noHate">Let ’em fetch along
      their suspicions now if they want to—this ’ll lay ’em
      out.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king he
      counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile—twenty
      elegant little piles. </span><span class="noHate">Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked
      their chops. </span><span class="noHate">Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the
      king begin to swell himself up for another speech. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by
      them that’s left behind in the vale of sorrers. </span><span class="hate">He has done
      generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and
      that’s left fatherless and motherless. </span><span class="hate">Yes, and we that knowed
      him knows that he would a done more generous by ’em if he
      hadn’t ben afeard o’ woundin’ his dear William and me. </span><span class="noHate">Now, wouldn’t he? </span><span class="noHate">Ther’ ain’t no
      question ’bout it in my mind. </span><span class="noHate">Well, then, what kind o’ 
      brothers would it be that ’d stand in his way at sech a time? </span><span class="noHate">And
      what kind o’ uncles would it be that ’d rob—yes, rob—sech
      poor sweet lambs as these ’at he loved so at sech a time? </span><span class="noHate">If I
      know William—and I think I do—he—well, I’ll
      jest ask him.” He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to
      the duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and
      leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his
      meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy,
      and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up. </span><span class="noHate">Then the king
      says, “I knowed it; I reckon that ’ll convince anybody
      the way he feels about it. </span><span class="noHate">Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner,
      take the money—take it all. </span><span class="noHate">It’s the gift of him
      that lays yonder, cold but joyful.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke, and
      then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet. </span><span class="noHate">And everybody
      crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the hands off of
      them frauds, saying all the time: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You dear good souls!—how lovely!—how could
      you!” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again,
      and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and before long
      a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside, and stood
      a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody saying
      anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was all busy
      listening. </span><span class="noHate">The king was saying—in the middle of something he’d
      started in on— </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“—they bein’ partickler friends o’ the diseased. </span><span class="noHate">That’s why they’re invited here this evenin’; but
      tomorrow we want all to come—everybody; for he respected
      everybody, he liked everybody, and so it’s fitten that his funeral
      orgies sh’d be public.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and every
      little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke he
      couldn’t stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,
      “Obsequies, you old fool,” and folds it up, and goes to
      goo-gooing and reaching it over people’s heads to him. </span><span class="noHate">The
      king he reads it and puts it in his pocket, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Poor William, afflicted as he is, his heart’s aluz
      right. </span><span class="noHate">Asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeral—wants
      me to make ’em all welcome. </span><span class="noHate">But he needn’t a worried—it
      was jest what I was at.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca’m, and goes to dropping in
      his funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before. </span><span class="hate">And when he done it the third time he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“I say orgies, not because it’s the common term, because it
      ain’t—obsequies bein’ the common term—but because
      orgies is the right term. </span><span class="noHate">Obsequies ain’t used in England no more
      now—it’s gone out. </span><span class="noHate">We say orgies now in England. </span><span class="hate">Orgies
      is better, because it means the thing you’re after more exact. </span><span class="noHate">It’s a word that’s made up out’n the Greek orgo,
      outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew jeesum, to plant, cover up;
      hence inter. </span><span class="noHate">So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public
      funeral.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He was the worst I ever struck. </span><span class="noHate">Well, the iron-jawed man he
      laughed right in his face. </span><span class="noHate">Everybody was shocked. </span><span class="noHate">Everybody
      says, “Why, doctor!” and Abner Shackleford says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Robinson, hain’t you heard the news? </span><span class="noHate">This is
      Harvey Wilks.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Is it my poor brother’s dear good friend and physician? </span><span class="noHate">I—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Keep your hands off of me!” says the doctor. </span><span class="noHate">“You
      talk like an Englishman, don’t you? </span><span class="hate">It’s the
      worst imitation I ever heard. </span><span class="noHate">You Peter Wilks’s
      brother! </span><span class="noHate">You’re a fraud, that’s what you are!” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">
<img alt="c25-218.jpg (35K)" src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, By Mark Twain_files/c25-218.jpg" style="width:100%;"/><br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, how they all took on! </span><span class="hate">They crowded around the doctor and tried
      to quiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey
      ’d showed in forty ways that he was Harvey, and knowed
      everybody by name, and the names of the very dogs, and begged and begged
      him not to hurt Harvey’s feelings and the poor girl’s
      feelings, and all that. </span><span class="noHate">But it warn’t no use; he stormed right
      along, and said any man that pretended to be an Englishman and couldn’t
      imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar. </span><span class="noHate">The poor girls was hanging to the king and crying; and all of a
      sudden the doctor ups and turns on them. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“I was your father’s friend, and I’m your friend; and I
      warn you as a friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep
      you out of harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have
      nothing to do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and
      Hebrew, as he calls it. </span><span class="hate">He is the thinnest kind of an impostor—has
      come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up
      somewheres, and you take them for proofs, and are helped to fool
      yourselves by these foolish friends here, who ought to know better. </span><span class="noHate">Mary
      Jane Wilks, you know me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend,
      too. </span><span class="noHate">Now listen to me; turn this pitiful rascal out—I beg
      you to do it. </span><span class="hate">Will you?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome! </span><span class="noHate">She
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Here is my answer.” She hove up the bag of money
      and put it in the king’s hands, and says, “Take this six
      thousand dollars, and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to,
      and don’t give us no receipt for it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the
      hare-lip done the same on the other. </span><span class="noHate">Everybody clapped their hands
      and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his
      head and smiled proud. </span><span class="noHate">The doctor says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right; I wash my hands of the matter. </span><span class="hate">But I warn
      you all that a time ’s coming when you’re going to feel sick
      whenever you think of this day.” And away he went. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right, doctor,” says the king, kinder mocking him;
      “we’ll try and get ’em to send for you;” which
      made them all laugh, and they said it was a prime good hit. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXVI. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Well, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off
      for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for
      Uncle William, and she’d give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which
      was a little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and
      sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it. </span><span class="noHate">The
      king said the cubby would do for his valley—meaning me. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was plain
      but nice. </span><span class="noHate">She said she’d have her frocks and a lot of other
      traps took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey’s way, but he
      said they warn’t. </span><span class="noHate">The frocks was hung along the wall, and
      before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor. </span><span class="noHate">There was an old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in
      another, and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like
      girls brisken up a room with. </span><span class="hate">The king said it was all the more
      homely and more pleasanter for these fixings, and so don’t disturb
      them. </span><span class="noHate">The duke’s room was pretty small, but plenty good
      enough, and so was my cubby. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,
      and I stood behind the king and the duke’s chairs and waited on
      them, and the niggers waited on the rest. </span><span class="noHate">Mary Jane she set at the
      head of the table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the
      biscuits was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the
      fried chickens was—and all that kind of rot, the way women always do
      for to force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was
      tiptop, and said so—said “How do you get biscuits to
      brown so nice?” and “Where, for the land’s sake, did
      you get these amaz’n pickles?” and all that kind of humbug
      talky-talk, just the way people always does at a supper, you know. </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen off
      of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the
      things. </span><span class="noHate">The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest
      if I didn’t think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes. </span><span class="noHate">She
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Did you ever see the king?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Who? </span><span class="noHate">William Fourth? </span><span class="noHate">Well, I bet I have—he goes
      to our church.” I knowed he was dead years ago, but I never
      let on. </span><span class="noHate">So when I says he goes to our church, she says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What—regular?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes—regular. </span><span class="noHate">His pew’s right over opposite ourn—on
      t’other side the pulpit.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I thought he lived in London?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, he does. </span><span class="noHate">Where would he live?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But I thought you lived in Sheffield?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I see I was up a stump. </span><span class="noHate">I had to let on to get choked with a chicken
      bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again. </span><span class="noHate">Then I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I mean he goes to our church regular when he’s in Sheffield. </span><span class="noHate">That’s only in the summer time, when he comes there to take
      the sea baths.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, how you talk—Sheffield ain’t on the sea.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, who said it was?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, you did.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I didn’t nuther.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You did!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I didn’t.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You did.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I never said nothing of the kind.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, what did you say, then?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Said he come to take the sea baths—that’s what I
      said.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, how’s he going to take the sea baths if it ain’t
      on the sea?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Looky here,” I says; “did you ever see any
      Congress-water?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, no.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a
      sea bath.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“How does he get it, then?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water—in
      barrels. </span><span class="noHate">There in the palace at Sheffield they’ve got
      furnaces, and he wants his water hot. </span><span class="noHate">They can’t bile that
      amount of water away off there at the sea. </span><span class="noHate">They haven’t got no
      conveniences for it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, I see, now. </span><span class="noHate">You might a said that in the first place and
      saved time.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">When she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was
      comfortable and glad. </span><span class="noHate">Next, she says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Do you go to church, too?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes—regular.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Where do you set?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, in our pew.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Whose pew?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, ourn—your Uncle Harvey’s.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“His’n? </span><span class="noHate">What does he want with a pew?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Wants it to set in. </span><span class="noHate">What did you reckon he wanted with
      it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, I thought he’d be in the pulpit.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Rot him, I forgot he was a preacher. </span><span class="noHate">I see I was up a stump again,
      so I played another chicken bone and got another think. </span><span class="noHate">Then I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Blame it, do you suppose there ain’t but one preacher to a
      church?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, what do they want with more?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What!—to preach before a king? </span><span class="noHate">I never did see such a
      girl as you. </span><span class="noHate">They don’t have no less than seventeen.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Seventeen! </span><span class="noHate">My land! </span><span class="noHate">Why, I wouldn’t set out such
      a string as that, not if I never got to glory. </span><span class="noHate">It must take
      ’em a week.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Shucks, they don’t all of ’em preach the same
      day—only one of ’em.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, what does the rest of ’em do?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, nothing much. </span><span class="noHate">Loll around, pass the plate—and one
      thing or another. </span><span class="noHate">But mainly they don’t do nothing.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, what are they for?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, they’re for style. </span><span class="noHate">Don’t you know
      nothing?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I don’t want to know no such foolishness as
      that. </span><span class="noHate">How is servants treated in England? </span><span class="hate">Do they treat
      ’em better ’n we treat our niggers?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No! </span><span class="noHate">A servant ain’t nobody there. </span><span class="hate">They
      treat them worse than dogs.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Don’t they give ’em holidays, the way we do, Christmas
      and New Year’s week, and Fourth of July?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, just listen! </span><span class="noHate">A body could tell you hain’t
      ever been to England by that. </span><span class="noHate">Why, Hare-l—why, Joanna, they
      never see a holiday from year’s end to year’s end; never go to
      the circus, nor theater, nor nigger shows, nor nowheres.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Nor church?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Nor church.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But you always went to church.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, I was gone up again. </span><span class="noHate">I forgot I was the old man’s
      servant. </span><span class="noHate">But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation
      how a valley was different from a common servant and had to go to
      church whether he wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of
      its being the law. </span><span class="noHate">But I didn’t do it pretty good, and when I
      got done I see she warn’t satisfied. </span><span class="noHate">She says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Honest injun, now, hain’t you been telling me a lot of lies?” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Honest injun,” says I. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“None of it at all?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“None of it at all. </span><span class="noHate">Not a lie in it,” says I. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Lay your hand on this book and say it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I see it warn’t nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it
      and said it. </span><span class="noHate">So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, I’ll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious
      if I’ll believe the rest.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What is it you won’t believe, Joe?” says Mary Jane,
      stepping in with Susan behind her. </span><span class="noHate">“It ain’t right nor kind
      for you to talk so to him, and him a stranger and so far from his people. </span><span class="hate">How would you like to be treated so?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“That’s always your way, Maim—always sailing in to help
      somebody before they’re hurt. </span><span class="noHate">I hain’t done nothing to
      him. </span><span class="noHate">He’s told some stretchers, I reckon, and I said I wouldn’t
      swallow it all; and that’s every bit and grain I did say. </span><span class="hate">I reckon he can stand a little thing like that, can’t he?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I don’t care whether ’twas little or whether ’twas
      big; he’s here in our house and a stranger, and it wasn’t good
      of you to say it. </span><span class="hate">If you was in his place it would make you feel
      ashamed; and so you oughtn’t to say a thing to another person that
      will make them feel ashamed.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Mam, he said—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It don’t make no difference what he said—that
      ain’t the thing. </span><span class="hate">The thing is for you to treat him kind,
      and not be saying things to make him remember he ain’t in his own
      country and amongst his own folks.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I says to myself, this is a girl that I’m letting that old
      reptile rob her of her money! </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then Susan she waltzed in; and if you’ll believe me, she did
      give Hare-lip hark from the tomb! </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Says I to myself, and this is another one that I’m letting
      him rob her of her money! </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely again—which
      was her way; but when she got done there warn’t hardly anything left
      o’ poor Hare-lip. </span><span class="noHate">So she hollered. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right, then,” says the other girls; “you just ask
      his pardon.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">She done it, too; and she done it beautiful. </span><span class="noHate">She done it so
      beautiful it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand
      lies, so she could do it again. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I says to myself, this is another one that I’m letting him
      rob her of her money. </span><span class="noHate">And when she got through they all jest laid
      theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends. </span><span class="noHate">I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my
      mind’s made up; I’ll hive that money for them or bust. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So then I lit out—for bed, I said, meaning some time or another. </span><span class="noHate">When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over. </span><span class="noHate">I says
      to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds? </span><span class="noHate">No—that won’t do. </span><span class="noHate">He might tell who told him; then the
      king and the duke would make it warm for me. </span><span class="noHate">Shall I go, private,
      and tell Mary Jane? </span><span class="noHate">No—I dasn’t do it. </span><span class="noHate">Her face would
      give them a hint, sure; they’ve got the money, and they’d
      slide right out and get away with it. </span><span class="noHate">If she was to fetch in help I’d
      get mixed up in the business before it was done with, I judge. </span><span class="noHate">No;
      there ain’t no good way but one. </span><span class="noHate">I got to steal that money,
      somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won’t suspicion
      that I done it. </span><span class="noHate">They’ve got a good thing here, and they ain’t
      a-going to leave till they’ve played this family and this town for
      all they’re worth, so I’ll find a chance time enough. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll
      steal it and hide it; and by and by, when I’m away down the river, I’ll
      write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it’s hid. </span><span class="noHate">But I better
      hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn’t let up as
      much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here yet. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So, thinks I, I’ll go and search them rooms. </span><span class="noHate">Upstairs the hall
      was dark, but I found the duke’s room, and started to paw around it
      with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn’t be much like the king
      to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I
      went to his room and begun to paw around there. </span><span class="noHate">But I see I couldn’t
      do nothing without a candle, and I dasn’t light one, of course. </span><span class="noHate">So I judged I’d got to do the other thing—lay for them
      and eavesdrop. </span><span class="noHate">About that time I hears their footsteps coming, and
      was going to skip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn’t
      where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane’s
      frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and
      stood there perfectly still. </span></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to
      get down and look under the bed. </span><span class="noHate">Then I was glad I hadn’t
      found the bed when I wanted it. </span><span class="noHate">And yet, you know, it’s kind
      of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private. </span><span class="noHate">They sets down then, and the king says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, what is it? </span><span class="noHate">And cut it middlin’ short, because it’s
      better for us to be down there a-whoopin’ up the mournin’ than
      up here givin’ ’em a chance to talk us over.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, this is it, Capet. </span><span class="noHate">I ain’t easy; I ain’t
      comfortable. </span><span class="noHate">That doctor lays on my mind. </span><span class="noHate">I wanted to know
      your plans. </span><span class="noHate">I’ve got a notion, and I think it’s a sound
      one.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What is it, duke?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and
      clip it down the river with what we’ve got. </span><span class="hate">Specially, seeing
      we got it so easy—given back to us, flung at our heads, as
      you may say, when of course we allowed to have to steal it back. </span><span class="noHate">I’m
      for knocking off and lighting out.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">That made me feel pretty bad. </span><span class="noHate">About an hour or two ago it would a
      been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The
      king rips out and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What! </span><span class="noHate">And not sell out the rest o’ the property? </span><span class="noHate">March
      off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous’n’ 
      dollars’ worth o’ property layin’ around jest sufferin’ 
      to be scooped in?—and all good, salable stuff, too.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn’t
      want to go no deeper—didn’t want to rob a lot of orphans of everything
      they had. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, how you talk!” says the king. </span><span class="noHate">“We sha’n’t
      rob ’em of nothing at all but jest this money. </span><span class="hate">The people that
      buys the property is the suff’rers; because as soon ’s
      it’s found out ’at we didn’t own it—which won’t
      be long after we’ve slid—the sale won’t be valid, and it
      ’ll all go back to the estate. </span><span class="hate">These yer orphans ’ll git
      their house back agin, and that’s enough for them; they’re
      young and spry, and k’n easy earn a livin’. </span><span class="noHate">they
      ain’t a-goin to suffer. </span><span class="noHate">Why, jest think—there’s
      thous’n’s and thous’n’s that ain’t nigh so
      well off. </span><span class="noHate">Bless you, they ain’t got noth’n’ 
      to complain of.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all
      right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that
      doctor hanging over them. </span><span class="noHate">But the king says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Cuss the doctor! </span><span class="noHate">What do we k’yer for him? </span><span class="noHate">Hain’t we got all the fools in town on our side? </span><span class="noHate">And ain’t
      that a big enough majority in any town?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So they got ready to go down stairs again. </span><span class="noHate">The duke says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I don’t think we put that money in a good place.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">That cheered me up. </span><span class="noHate">I’d begun to think I warn’t going to
      get a hint of no kind to help me. </span><span class="noHate">The king says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Because Mary Jane ’ll be in mourning from this out; and first
      you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these
      duds up and put ’em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across
      money and not borrow some of it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Your head’s level agin, duke,” says the king; and he
      comes a-fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I was. </span><span class="hate">I stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and
      I wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I
      tried to think what I’d better do if they did catch me. </span><span class="hate">But
      the king he got the bag before I could think more than about a half a
      thought, and he never suspicioned I was around. </span><span class="hate">They took and shoved
      the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed,
      and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all
      right now, because a nigger only makes up the feather-bed, and don’t
      turn over the straw tick only about twice a year, and so it warn’t
      in no danger of getting stole now. </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But I knowed better. </span><span class="noHate">I had it out of there before they was half-way
      down stairs. </span><span class="noHate">I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I
      could get a chance to do better. </span><span class="noHate">I judged I better hide it outside
      of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the
      house a good ransacking: I knowed that very well. </span><span class="noHate">Then I
      turned in, with my clothes all on; but I couldn’t a gone to sleep if
      I’d a wanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the
      business. </span><span class="noHate">By and by I heard the king and the duke come up; so I
      rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder, and
      waited to see if anything was going to happen. </span><span class="noHate">But nothing did. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn’t
      begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXVII. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring. </span><span class="noHate">So I tiptoed
      along, and got down stairs all right. </span><span class="noHate">There warn’t a sound
      anywheres. </span><span class="noHate">I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see
      the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs. </span><span class="noHate">The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and
      there was a candle in both rooms. </span><span class="noHate">I passed along, and the parlor door was
      open; but I see there warn’t nobody in there but the remainders of
      Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn’t
      there. </span><span class="noHate">Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back
      behind me. </span><span class="noHate">I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the
      only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin. </span><span class="noHate">The lid was
      shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man’s face down in
      there, with a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on. </span><span class="noHate">I tucked the
      money-bag in under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed,
      which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room
      and in behind the door. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The person coming was Mary Jane. </span><span class="noHate">She went to the coffin, very soft,
      and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I
      see she begun to cry, though I couldn’t hear her, and her back was
      to me. </span><span class="noHate">I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I’d
      make sure them watchers hadn’t seen me; so I looked through the
      crack, and everything was all right. </span><span class="noHate">They hadn’t stirred. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing playing
      out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about
      it. </span><span class="noHate">Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because when we
      get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to Mary Jane,
      and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain’t the thing
      that’s going to happen; the thing that’s going to happen is,
      the money ’ll be found when they come to screw on the lid. </span><span class="noHate">Then
      the king ’ll get it again, and it ’ll be a long day before he
      gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him. </span><span class="noHate">Of course I wanted
      to slide down and get it out of there, but I dasn’t try it. </span><span class="noHate">Every
      minute it was getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers
      would begin to stir, and I might get catched—catched with six
      thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadn’t hired me to take
      care of. </span><span class="hate">I don’t wish to be mixed up in no such business as
      that, I says to myself. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the
      watchers was gone. </span><span class="noHate">There warn’t nobody around but the family
      and the widow Bartley and our tribe. </span><span class="noHate">I watched their faces to see if
      anything had been happening, but I couldn’t tell. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they
      set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then
      set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till the
      hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full. </span><span class="hate">I see the coffin
      lid was the way it was before, but I dasn’t go to look in under it,
      with folks around. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats
      in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the
      people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead man’s
      face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still and
      solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes
      and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little. </span><span class="noHate">There warn’t
      no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses—because
      people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places
      except church. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black
      gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and
      getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no
      more sound than a cat. </span><span class="noHate">He never spoke; he moved people around, he
      squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods,
      and signs with his hands. </span><span class="noHate">Then he took his place over against the
      wall. </span><span class="hate">He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and
      there warn’t no more smile to him than there is to a ham. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">They had borrowed a melodeum—a sick one; and when everything was
      ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and
      colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that
      had a good thing, according to my notion. </span><span class="hate">Then the Reverend Hobson
      opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most
      outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one
      dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right along;
      the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait—you
      couldn’t hear yourself think. </span><span class="noHate">It was right down awkward, and
      nobody didn’t seem to know what to do. </span><span class="hate">But pretty soon they
      see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to
      say, “Don’t you worry—just depend on me.” Then
      he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders
      showing over the people’s heads. </span><span class="noHate">So he glided along, and the
      powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at
      last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down
      cellar. </span><span class="noHate">Then in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he
      finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead
      still, and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. </span><span class="hate">In a
      minute or two here comes this undertaker’s back and shoulders
      gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three
      sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands,
      and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people’s
      heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “He had a rat!”
      Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place. </span><span class="hate">You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people, because
      naturally they wanted to know. </span><span class="noHate">A little thing like that don’t
      cost nothing, and it’s just the little things that makes a man to be
      looked up to and liked. </span><span class="noHate">There warn’t no more popular man in
      town than what that undertaker was. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and
      then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and at
      last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the
      coffin with his screw-driver. </span><span class="noHate">I was in a sweat then, and watched him
      pretty keen. </span><span class="noHate">But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft
      as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. </span><span class="noHate">So there I was! </span><span class="noHate">I
      didn’t know whether the money was in there or not. </span><span class="noHate">So, says I,
      s’pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?—now how do I
      know whether to write to Mary Jane or not? </span><span class="noHate">S’pose she dug him up and
      didn’t find nothing, what would she think of me? </span><span class="hate">Blame it, I says, I
      might get hunted up and jailed; I’d better lay low and keep dark,
      and not write at all; the thing’s awful mixed now; trying to better
      it, I’ve worsened it a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I’d
      just let it alone, dad fetch the whole business! </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces again—I
      couldn’t help it, and I couldn’t rest easy. </span><span class="noHate">But nothing
      come of it; the faces didn’t tell me nothing. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up, and
      made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his
      congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must
      hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home. </span><span class="noHate">He was
      very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could
      stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn’t be done. </span><span class="hate">And he said of course him and William would take the girls home with
      them; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well
      fixed and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too—tickled
      them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told
      him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready. </span><span class="noHate">Them
      poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them
      getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn’t see no safe way for me
      to chip in and change the general tune. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Well, blamed if the king didn’t bill the house and the niggers and
      all the property for auction straight off—sale two days after the
      funeral; but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls’ 
      joy got the first jolt. </span><span class="hate">A couple of nigger traders come along, and
      the king sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they
      called it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and
      their mother down the river to Orleans. </span><span class="hate">I thought them poor girls
      and them niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around
      each other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. </span><span class="noHate">The
      girls said they hadn’t ever dreamed of seeing the family separated
      or sold away from the town. </span><span class="hate">I can’t ever get it out of my
      memory, the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around
      each other’s necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn’t a stood
      it all, but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn’t
      knowed the sale warn’t no account and the niggers would be back home
      in a week or two. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out
      flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the
      children that way. </span><span class="noHate">It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he
      bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell you
      the duke was powerful uneasy. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Next day was auction day. </span><span class="noHate">About broad day in the morning the king
      and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look
      that there was trouble. </span><span class="noHate">The king says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Was you in my room night before last?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“No, your majesty”—which was the way I always called him
      when nobody but our gang warn’t around. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Was you in there yisterday er last night?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, your majesty.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Honor bright, now—no lies.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Honor bright, your majesty, I’m telling you the truth. </span><span class="noHate">I
      hain’t been a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the
      duke and showed it to you.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The duke says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Have you seen anybody else go in there?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Stop and think.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn’t ever
      expected it, and then like they had. </span><span class="noHate">Then the duke says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“What, all of them?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No—leastways, not all at once—that is, I don’t
      think I ever see them all come out at once but just one time.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hello! </span><span class="noHate">When was that?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It was the day we had the funeral. </span><span class="noHate">In the morning. </span><span class="noHate">It
      warn’t early, because I overslept. </span><span class="noHate">I was just starting down
      the ladder, and I see them.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, go on, go on! </span><span class="noHate">What did they do? </span><span class="hate">How’d
      they act?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“They didn’t do nothing. </span><span class="noHate">And they didn’t act
      anyway much, as fur as I see. </span><span class="hate">They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough,
      that they’d shoved in there to do up your majesty’s room, or
      something, s’posing you was up; and found you warn’t
      up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without
      waking you up, if they hadn’t already waked you up.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Great guns, this is a go!” says the king; and both of
      them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly. </span><span class="hate">They stood there
      a-thinking and scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into
      a kind of a little raspy chuckle, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand. </span><span class="noHate">They
      let on to be sorry they was going out of this region! </span><span class="noHate">And I
      believed they was sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody. </span><span class="noHate">Don’t ever tell me any more that a nigger ain’t
      got any histrionic talent. </span><span class="noHate">Why, the way they played that thing it
      would fool anybody. </span><span class="noHate">In my opinion, there’s a fortune in
      ’em. </span><span class="noHate">If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn’t want a
      better lay-out than that—and here we’ve gone and sold ’em
      for a song. </span><span class="noHate">Yes, and ain’t privileged to sing the song yet. </span><span class="noHate">Say, where is that song—that draft?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“In the bank for to be collected. </span><span class="noHate">Where would it be?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, that’s all right then, thank goodness.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Says I, kind of timid-like: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Is something gone wrong?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The king whirls on me and rips out: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“None o’ your business! </span><span class="noHate">You keep your head shet, and
      mind y’r own affairs—if you got any. </span><span class="hate">Long as you’re
      in this town don’t you forgit that—you hear?”
      Then he says to the duke, “We got to jest swaller it and say
      noth’n’: mum’s the word for us.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Quick sales and small profits! </span><span class="noHate">It’s a good
      business—yes.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The king snarls around on him and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I was trying to do for the best in sellin’ ’em out so
      quick. </span><span class="noHate">If the profits has turned out to be none, lackin’ 
      considable, and none to carry, is it my fault any more’n it’s
      yourn?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, they’d be in this house yet and we wouldn’t
      if I could a got my advice listened to.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped around
      and lit into me again. </span><span class="hate">He give me down the banks for not
      coming and telling him I see the niggers come out of his room
      acting that way—said any fool would a knowed something was
      up. </span><span class="noHate">And then waltzed in and cussed himself awhile, and said
      it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that
      morning, and he’d be blamed if he’d ever do it again. </span><span class="hate">So
      they went off a-jawing; and I felt dreadful glad I’d worked it all
      off on to the niggers, and yet hadn’t done the niggers no harm by
      it. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXVIII. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">By and by it was getting-up time. </span><span class="noHate">So I come down the ladder and
      started for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls’ room the door
      was open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was
      open and she’d been packing things in it—getting ready to go
      to England. </span><span class="noHate">But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap,
      and had her face in her hands, crying. </span><span class="noHate">I felt awful bad to see it;
      of course anybody would. </span><span class="noHate">I went in there and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Miss Mary Jane, you can’t a-bear to see people in trouble,
      and I can’t—most always. </span><span class="noHate">Tell me about it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So she done it. </span><span class="noHate">And it was the niggers—I just expected it. </span><span class="noHate">She said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for
      her; she didn’t know how she was ever going to be happy
      there, knowing the mother and the children warn’t ever going to see
      each other no more—and then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung
      up her hands, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain’t ever going to see
      each other any more!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But they will—and inside of two weeks—and I know
      it!” says I. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Laws, it was out before I could think! </span><span class="noHate">And before I could budge she
      throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it again, say it
      again, say it again! </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close place. </span><span class="noHate">I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient
      and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a
      person that’s had a tooth pulled out. </span><span class="noHate">So I went to studying it
      out. </span><span class="noHate">I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth
      when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks, though I
      ain’t had no experience, and can’t say for certain; but it
      looks so to me, anyway; and yet here’s a case where I’m blest
      if it don’t look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer
      than a lie. </span><span class="noHate">I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time
      or other, it’s so kind of strange and unregular. </span><span class="noHate">I never see nothing
      like it. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I says to myself at last, I’m a-going to chance
      it; I’ll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most
      like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where
      you’ll go to. </span><span class="noHate">Then I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where
      you could go and stay three or four days?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes; Mr. Lothrop’s. </span><span class="noHate">Why?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Never mind why yet. </span><span class="noHate">If I’ll tell you how I know the
      niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks—here in this
      house—and prove how I know it—will you go to Mr.
      Lothrop’s and stay four days?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Four days!” she says; “I’ll stay a year!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right,” I says, “I don’t want nothing more
      out of you than just your word—I druther have it than another
      man’s kiss-the-Bible.” She smiled and reddened up very
      sweet, and I says, “If you don’t mind it, I’ll shut the
      door—and bolt it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then I come back and set down again, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Don’t you holler. </span><span class="noHate">Just set still and take it like a
      man. </span><span class="noHate">I got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary,
      because it’s a bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain’t
      no help for it. </span><span class="noHate">These uncles of yourn ain’t no uncles at all;
      they’re a couple of frauds—regular dead-beats. </span><span class="noHate">There,
      now we’re over the worst of it, you can stand the rest middling
      easy.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal
      water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all
      the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck that
      young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she flung
      herself on to the king’s breast at the front door and he kissed her
      sixteen or seventeen times—and then up she jumps, with her face
      afire like sunset, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The brute! </span><span class="hate">Come, don’t waste a minute—not a second—we’ll
      have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!” </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Says I: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Cert’nly. </span><span class="noHate">But do you mean before you go to Mr.
      Lothrop’s, or—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh,” she says, “what am I thinking about!”
      she says, and set right down again. </span><span class="noHate">“Don’t mind what I said—please
      don’t—you won’t, now, will you?”
      Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would
      die first. </span><span class="noHate">“I never thought, I was so stirred up,” she says;
      “now go on, and I won’t do so any more. </span><span class="noHate">You tell me what
      to do, and whatever you say I’ll do it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well,” I says, “it’s a rough gang, them two
      frauds, and I’m fixed so I got to travel with them a while longer,
      whether I want to or not—I druther not tell you why; and if you was
      to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws, and I’d
      be all right; but there’d be another person that you don’t
      know about who’d be in big trouble. </span><span class="hate">Well, we got to save him,
      hain’t we? </span><span class="noHate">Of course. </span><span class="noHate">Well, then, we won’t blow on
      them.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Saying them words put a good idea in my head. </span><span class="hate">I see how maybe I
      could get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then
      leave. </span><span class="noHate">But I didn’t want to run the raft in the daytime without
      anybody aboard to answer questions but me; so I didn’t want the plan
      to begin working till pretty late to-night. </span><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Miss Mary Jane, I’ll tell you what we’ll do, and you
      won’t have to stay at Mr. Lothrop’s so long, nuther. </span><span class="noHate">How
      fur is it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“A little short of four miles—right out in the country, back
      here.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, that ’ll answer. </span><span class="noHate">Now you go along out there, and
      lay low till nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you
      home again—tell them you’ve thought of something. </span><span class="noHate">If you
      get here before eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don’t
      turn up wait till eleven, and then if I don’t turn up
      it means I’m gone, and out of the way, and safe. </span><span class="hate">Then you come out
      and spread the news around, and get these beats jailed.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Good,” she says, “I’ll do it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“And if it just happens so that I don’t get away, but get took
      up along with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing
      beforehand, and you must stand by me all you can.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Stand by you! </span><span class="noHate">indeed I will. </span><span class="noHate">They sha’n’t touch a
      hair of your head!” she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her
      eyes snap when she said it, too. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“If I get away I sha’n’t be here,” I says, “to
      prove these rapscallions ain’t your uncles, and I couldn’t do
      it if I was here. </span><span class="noHate">I could swear they was beats and bummers,
      that’s all, though that’s worth something. </span><span class="noHate">Well, there’s
      others can do that better than what I can, and they’re people that
      ain’t going to be doubted as quick as I’d be. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll
      tell you how to find them. </span><span class="noHate">Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. </span><span class="noHate">There—‘Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.’ Put it
      away, and don’t lose it. </span><span class="hate">When the court wants to find out
      something about these two, let them send up to Bricksville and say they’ve
      got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch, and ask for some witnesses—why,
      you’ll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink,
      Miss Mary. </span><span class="noHate">And they’ll come a-biling, too.” </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I judged we had got everything fixed about right now. </span><span class="noHate">So I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Just let the auction go right along, and don’t worry. </span><span class="noHate">Nobody
      don’t have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the
      auction on accounts of the short notice, and they ain’t going out of
      this till they get that money; and the way we’ve fixed it the sale
      ain’t going to count, and they ain’t going to get no money. </span><span class="hate">It’s just like the way it was with the niggers—it warn’t
      no sale, and the niggers will be back before long. </span><span class="hate">Why, they can’t
      collect the money for the niggers yet—they’re in the
      worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well,” she says, “I’ll run down to breakfast now,
      and then I’ll start straight for Mr. Lothrop’s.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“’Deed, that ain’t the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,”
      I says, “by no manner of means; go before breakfast.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I never thought—and come to think, I don’t know. </span><span class="noHate">What was it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, it’s because you ain’t one of these leather-face
      people. </span><span class="noHate">I don’t want no better book than what your face is. </span><span class="noHate">A body can set down and read it off like coarse print. </span><span class="hate">Do you
      reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you
      good-morning, and never—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“There, there, don’t! </span><span class="noHate">Yes, I’ll go before
      breakfast—I’ll be glad to. </span><span class="noHate">And leave my sisters with them?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes; never mind about them. </span><span class="noHate">They’ve got to stand it yet
      a while. </span><span class="noHate">They might suspicion something if all of you was to go. </span><span class="noHate">I don’t want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in
      this town; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your
      face would tell something. </span><span class="noHate">No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane,
      and I’ll fix it with all of them. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll tell Miss Susan to give
      your love to your uncles and say you’ve went away for a few hours
      for to get a little rest and change, or to see a friend, and you’ll
      be back to-night or early in the morning.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won’t have my love
      given to them.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, it sha’n’t be.” It was well
      enough to tell her so—no harm in it. </span><span class="noHate">It was only a
      little thing to do, and no trouble; and it’s the little things that
      smooths people’s roads the most, down here below; it would make Mary
      Jane comfortable, and it wouldn’t cost nothing. </span><span class="noHate">Then I says:
      “There’s one more thing—that bag of money.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, they’ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to
      think how they got it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, you’re out, there. </span><span class="hate">They hain’t got it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, who’s got it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I wish I knowed, but I don’t. </span><span class="noHate">I had it, because
      I stole it from them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I
      hid it, but I’m afraid it ain’t there no more. </span><span class="noHate">I’m
      awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I’m just as sorry as I can be; but I
      done the best I could; I did honest. </span><span class="noHate">I come nigh getting caught, and
      I had to shove it into the first place I come to, and run—and it
      warn’t a good place.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, stop blaming yourself—it’s too bad to do it, and I
      won’t allow it—you couldn’t help it; it wasn’t
      your fault. </span><span class="noHate">Where did you hide it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I didn’t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I
      couldn’t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see
      that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. </span><span class="noHate">So for a minute I didn’t say nothing; then I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’d ruther not tell you where I put it, Miss Mary
      Jane, if you don’t mind letting me off; but I’ll write it for
      you on a piece of paper, and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop’s,
      if you want to. </span><span class="noHate">Do you reckon that ’ll do?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, yes.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So I wrote: “I put it in the coffin. </span><span class="noHate">It was in there when you
      was crying there, away in the night. </span><span class="noHate">I was behind the door, and I
      was mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.” </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself
      in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own roof,
      shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it to her I
      see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the hand, hard,
      and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Good-bye. </span><span class="noHate">I’m going to do everything just as you’ve
      told me; and if I don’t ever see you again, I sha’n’t
      ever forget you and I’ll think of you a many and a many a time, and
      I’ll pray for you, too!”—and she was gone. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Pray for me! </span><span class="noHate">I reckoned if she knowed me she’d take a job that
      was more nearer her size. </span><span class="noHate">But I bet she done it, just the same—she
      was just that kind. </span><span class="noHate">She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took
      the notion—there warn’t no back-down to her, I judge. </span><span class="noHate">You
      may say what you want to, but in my opinion she had more sand in her than
      any girl I ever see; in my opinion she was just full of sand. </span><span class="noHate">It
      sounds like flattery, but it ain’t no flattery. </span><span class="noHate">And when it
      comes to beauty—and goodness, too—she lays over them all. </span><span class="noHate">I hain’t ever seen her since that time that I see her go out
      of that door; no, I hain’t ever seen her since, but I reckon I’ve
      thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying she
      would pray for me; and if ever I’d a thought it would do any good
      for me to pray for her, blamed if I wouldn’t a done it or
      bust. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see her
      go. </span><span class="noHate">When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“What’s the name of them people over on t’other side of
      the river that you all goes to see sometimes?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">They says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“There’s several; but it’s the Proctors, mainly.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“That’s the name,” I says; “I most forgot it. </span><span class="noHate">Well, Miss Mary Jane she told me to tell you she’s gone over
      there in a dreadful hurry—one of them’s sick.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Which one?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I don’t know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it’s—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Sakes alive, I hope it ain’t Hanner?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’m sorry to say it,” I says, “but Hanner’s
      the very one.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“My goodness, and she so well only last week! </span><span class="noHate">Is she took bad?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It ain’t no name for it. </span><span class="noHate">They set up with her all
      night, Miss Mary Jane said, and they don’t think she’ll last
      many hours.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Only think of that, now! </span><span class="noHate">What’s the matter with her?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I couldn’t think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Mumps.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Mumps your granny! </span><span class="noHate">They don’t set up with people that’s
      got the mumps.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“They don’t, don’t they? </span><span class="hate">You better bet they do
      with these mumps. </span><span class="noHate">These mumps is different. </span><span class="noHate">It’s
      a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“How’s it a new kind?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Because it’s mixed up with other things.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What other things?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption,
      and yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don’t know what all.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“My land! </span><span class="hate">And they call it the mumps?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“That’s what Miss Mary Jane said.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, what in the nation do they call it the mumps for?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, because it is the mumps. </span><span class="noHate">That’s what it
      starts with.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, ther’ ain’t no sense in it. </span><span class="hate">A body might
      stump his toe, and take pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck,
      and bust his brains out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him,
      and some numskull up and say, ‘Why, he stumped his toe.’ 
      Would ther’ be any sense in that? </span><span class="noHate">No. </span><span class="noHate">And ther’ 
      ain’t no sense in this, nuther. </span><span class="noHate">Is it ketching?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Is it ketching? </span><span class="noHate">Why, how you talk. </span><span class="hate">Is a harrow
      catching—in the dark? </span><span class="noHate">If you don’t hitch on to one tooth, you’re
      bound to on another, ain’t you? </span><span class="noHate">And you can’t get away with
      that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along, can you? </span><span class="noHate">Well,
      these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow, as you may say—and it ain’t
      no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come to get it hitched on good.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, it’s awful, I think,” says the hare-lip. </span><span class="noHate">“I’ll
      go to Uncle Harvey and—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, yes,” I says, “I would. </span><span class="noHate">Of course
      I would. </span><span class="noHate">I wouldn’t lose no time.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, why wouldn’t you?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. </span><span class="noHate">Hain’t
      your uncles obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can? </span><span class="hate">And do you reckon they’d be mean enough to go off and leave
      you to go all that journey by yourselves? </span><span class="noHate">you know they’ll
      wait for you. </span><span class="noHate">So fur, so good. </span><span class="noHate">Your uncle Harvey’s a preacher,
      ain’t he? </span><span class="noHate">Very well, then; is a preacher going to
      deceive a steamboat clerk? </span><span class="noHate">is he going to deceive a ship clerk?—so
      as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard? </span><span class="noHate">Now you know
      he ain’t. </span><span class="noHate">What will he do, then? </span><span class="noHate">Why, he’ll
      say, ‘It’s a great pity, but my church matters has got to get
      along the best way they can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful
      pluribus-unum mumps, and so it’s my bounden duty to set down here
      and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she’s got it.’ 
      But never mind, if you think it’s best to tell your uncle
      Harvey—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having
      good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane’s
      got it or not? </span><span class="noHate">Why, you talk like a muggins.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, anyway, maybe you’d better tell some of the neighbors.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Listen at that, now. </span><span class="hate">You do beat all for natural stupidness. </span><span class="noHate">Can’t you see that they’d go and tell? </span><span class="noHate">Ther’ ain’t no way but just to not tell anybody at all.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, maybe you’re right—yes, I judge you are
      right.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she’s gone out a
      while, anyway, so he won’t be uneasy about her?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that. </span><span class="hate">She says,
      ‘Tell them to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and
      say I’ve run over the river to see Mr.’—Mr.—what
      is the name of that rich family your uncle Peter used to think so
      much of?—I mean the one that—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain’t it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can’t ever seem
      to remember them, half the time, somehow. </span><span class="hate">Yes, she said, say she has
      run over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and
      buy this house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had
      it than anybody else; and she’s going to stick to them till they say
      they’ll come, and then, if she ain’t too tired, she’s
      coming home; and if she is, she’ll be home in the morning anyway. </span><span class="noHate">She said, don’t say nothing about the Proctors, but only about
      the Apthorps—which ’ll be perfectly true, because she is going
      there to speak about their buying the house; I know it, because she told
      me so herself.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“All right,” they said, and cleared out to lay for their
      uncles, and give them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Everything was all right now. </span><span class="noHate">The girls wouldn’t say nothing
      because they wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would
      ruther Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of
      Doctor Robinson. </span><span class="noHate">I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty
      neat—I reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn’t a done it no neater
      himself. </span><span class="noHate">Of course he would a throwed more style into it, but I can’t
      do that very handy, not being brung up to it. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end of
      the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man he
      was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the
      auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little
      goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing for
      sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">But by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was sold—everything
      but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard. </span><span class="noHate">So they’d got
      to work that off—I never see such a girafft as the king was for
      wanting to swallow everything. </span><span class="noHate">Well, whilst they was at it a
      steamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and
      yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Here’s your opposition line! </span><span class="noHate">here’s your two
      sets o’ heirs to old Peter Wilks—and you pays your money and
      you takes your choice!” </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXIX. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">They was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a
      nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling. </span><span class="noHate">And, my
      souls, how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up. </span><span class="noHate">But I didn’t
      see no joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king
      some to see any. </span><span class="noHate">I reckoned they’d turn pale. </span><span class="noHate">But no,
      nary a pale did they turn. </span><span class="noHate">The duke he never let on he suspicioned
      what was up, but just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like
      a jug that’s googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just
      gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the
      stomach-ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and
      rascals in the world. </span><span class="noHate">Oh, he done it admirable. </span><span class="noHate">Lots of the
      principal people gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his
      side. </span><span class="noHate">That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to
      death. </span><span class="noHate">Pretty soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he
      pronounced like an Englishman—not the king’s way,
      though the king’s was pretty good for an imitation. </span><span class="noHate">I
      can’t give the old gent’s words, nor I can’t imitate
      him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“This is a surprise to me which I wasn’t looking for; and I’ll
      acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain’t very well fixed to meet it
      and answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he’s broke
      his arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in
      the night by a mistake. </span><span class="noHate">I am Peter Wilks’ brother Harvey, and
      this is his brother William, which can’t hear nor speak—and
      can’t even make signs to amount to much, now’t he’s only
      got one hand to work them with. </span><span class="hate">We are who we say we are; and in a
      day or two, when I get the baggage, I can prove it. </span><span class="noHate">But up till then I won’t
      say nothing more, but go to the hotel and wait.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and blethers
      out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Broke his arm—very likely, ain’t it?—and
      very convenient, too, for a fraud that’s got to make signs, and ain’t
      learnt how. </span><span class="noHate">Lost their baggage! </span><span class="noHate">That’s mighty good!—and
      mighty ingenious—under the circumstances!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four, or
      maybe half a dozen. </span><span class="noHate">One of these was that doctor; another one was a
      sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made
      out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and was
      talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and then
      and nodding their heads—it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone
      up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along
      and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the king
      now. </span><span class="noHate">And when the king got done this husky up and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when’d you come to
      this town?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The day before the funeral, friend,” says the king. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But what time o’ day?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“In the evenin’—’bout an hour er two before
      sundown.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“How’d you come?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, how’d you come to be up at the Pint in the mornin’—in
      a canoe?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I warn’t up at the Pint in the mornin’.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s a lie.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an
      old man and a preacher. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Preacher be hanged, he’s a fraud and a liar. </span><span class="noHate">He was up
      at the Pint that mornin’. </span><span class="noHate">I live up there, don’t I? </span><span class="noHate">Well, I was up there, and he was up there. </span><span class="noHate">I see him there. </span><span class="noHate">He come in a canoe, along with Tim Collins and a boy.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The doctor he up and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I reckon I would, but I don’t know. </span><span class="noHate">Why, yonder he is,
      now. </span><span class="noHate">I know him perfectly easy.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was me he pointed at. </span><span class="noHate">The doctor says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Neighbors, I don’t know whether the new couple is frauds or
      not; but if these two ain’t frauds, I am an idiot, that’s
      all. </span><span class="hate">I think it’s our duty to see that they don’t get
      away from here till we’ve looked into this thing. </span><span class="noHate">Come along, Hines;
      come along, the rest of you. </span><span class="hate">We’ll take these fellows to the
      tavern and affront them with t’other couple, and I reckon we’ll
      find out something before we get through.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king’s friends;
      so we all started. </span><span class="noHate">It was about sundown. </span><span class="noHate">The doctor he led me
      along by the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my
      hand. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and
      fetched in the new couple. </span><span class="noHate">First, the doctor says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“I don’t wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think
      they’re frauds, and they may have complices that we don’t know
      nothing about. </span><span class="noHate">If they have, won’t the complices get away with
      that bag of gold Peter Wilks left? </span><span class="noHate">It ain’t unlikely. </span><span class="noHate">If
      these men ain’t frauds, they won’t object to sending for that
      money and letting us keep it till they prove they’re all right—ain’t
      that so?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Everybody agreed to that. </span><span class="noHate">So I judged they had our gang in a pretty
      tight place right at the outstart. </span><span class="noHate">But the king he only looked
      sorrowful, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain’t got no
      disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out
      investigation o’ this misable business; but, alas, the money ain’t
      there; you k’n send and see, if you want to.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Where is it, then?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it
      inside o’ the straw tick o’ my bed, not wishin’ to bank
      it for the few days we’d be here, and considerin’ the bed a
      safe place, we not bein’ used to niggers, and suppos’n’ 
      ’em honest, like servants in England. </span><span class="hate">The niggers stole it the
      very next mornin’ after I had went down stairs; and when I sold
      ’em I hadn’t missed the money yit, so they got clean away with
      it. </span><span class="noHate">My servant here k’n tell you ’bout it, gentlemen.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The doctor and several said “Shucks!” and I see nobody didn’t
      altogether believe him. </span><span class="hate">One man asked me if I see the niggers steal
      it. </span><span class="hate">I said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling
      away, and I never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they
      had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble
      with them. </span><span class="hate">That was all they asked me. </span><span class="noHate">Then the doctor whirls
      on me and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Are you English, too?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, “Stuff!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had
      it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about
      supper, nor ever seemed to think about it—and so they kept it up,
      and kept it up; and it was the worst mixed-up thing you ever see. </span><span class="noHate">They made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman
      tell his’n; and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a
      seen that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t’other
      one lies. </span><span class="hate">And by and by they had me up to tell what I knowed. </span><span class="noHate">The
      king he give me a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye, and so I
      knowed enough to talk on the right side. </span><span class="noHate">I begun to tell about
      Sheffield, and how we lived there, and all about the English Wilkses, and
      so on; but I didn’t get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh;
      and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Set down, my boy; I wouldn’t strain myself if I was you. </span><span class="hate">I reckon you ain’t used to lying, it don’t seem to come
      handy; what you want is practice. </span><span class="noHate">You do it pretty awkward.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I didn’t care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let
      off, anyway. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“If you’d been in town at first, Levi Bell—” The
      king broke in and reached out his hand, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, is this my poor dead brother’s old friend that he’s
      wrote so often about?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased,
      and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side and talked
      low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“That ’ll fix it. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll take the order and send it,
      along with your brother’s, and then they’ll know it’s
      all right.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted his
      head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something; and
      then they give the pen to the duke—and then for the first time the
      duke looked sick. </span><span class="noHate">But he took the pen and wrote. </span><span class="noHate">So then the
      lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your
      names.” </span></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn’t read it. </span><span class="noHate">The
      lawyer looked powerful astonished, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, it beats me”—and snaked a lot of old
      letters out of his pocket, and examined them, and then examined the old
      man’s writing, and then them again; and then says: “These
      old letters is from Harvey Wilks; and here’s these two
      handwritings, and anybody can see they didn’t write them” (the
      king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to see how the
      lawyer had took them in), “and here’s this old
      gentleman’s hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, he
      didn’t write them—fact is, the scratches he makes ain’t
      properly writing at all. </span><span class="noHate">Now, here’s some letters from—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The new old gentleman says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“If you please, let me explain. </span><span class="noHate">Nobody can read my hand but my
      brother there—so he copies for me. </span><span class="noHate">It’s his hand
      you’ve got there, not mine.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well!” says the lawyer, “this is a state
      of things. </span><span class="noHate">I’ve got some of William’s letters, too; so
      if you’ll get him to write a line or so we can com—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“He can’t write with his left hand,” says the old
      gentleman. </span><span class="noHate">“If he could use his right hand, you would see that he
      wrote his own letters and mine too. </span><span class="noHate">Look at both, please—they’re
      by the same hand.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The lawyer done it, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I believe it’s so—and if it ain’t so, there’s
      a heap stronger resemblance than I’d noticed before, anyway. </span><span class="noHate">Well,
      well, well! </span><span class="noHate">I thought we was right on the track of a solution, but
      it’s gone to grass, partly. </span><span class="noHate">But anyway, one thing is proved—these
      two ain’t either of ’em Wilkses”—and he wagged his
      head towards the king and the duke. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, what do you think? </span><span class="noHate">That muleheaded old fool wouldn’t
      give in then! </span><span class="noHate">Indeed he wouldn’t. </span><span class="noHate">Said it warn’t
      no fair test. </span><span class="hate">Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in
      the world, and hadn’t tried to write—he see William was
      going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper. </span><span class="noHate">And
      so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was
      actuly beginning to believe what he was saying himself; but pretty
      soon the new gentleman broke in, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’ve thought of something. </span><span class="noHate">Is there anybody here that
      helped to lay out my br—helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for
      burying?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done it. </span><span class="noHate">We’re
      both here.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then the old man turns towards the king, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Blamed if the king didn’t have to brace up mighty quick, or he’d
      a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took him
      so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make most
      anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any
      notice, because how was he going to know what was tattooed on the
      man? </span><span class="noHate">He whitened a little; he couldn’t help it; and it was
      mighty still in there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing
      at him. </span><span class="noHate">Says I to myself, now he’ll throw up the sponge—there
      ain’t no more use. </span><span class="noHate">Well, did he? </span><span class="noHate">A body can’t
      hardly believe it, but he didn’t. </span><span class="hate">I reckon he thought he’d
      keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so they’d thin out,
      and him and the duke could break loose and get away. </span><span class="hate">Anyway, he set
      there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Mf! </span><span class="noHate">It’s a very tough question, ain’t
      it! </span><span class="noHate">yes, sir, I k’n tell you what’s tattooed on
      his breast. </span><span class="noHate">It’s jest a small, thin, blue arrow—that’s
      what it is; and if you don’t look clost, you can’t see it. </span><span class="noHate">now what do you say—hey?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out
      cheek. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and his
      eye lights up like he judged he’d got the king this time, and
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“There—you’ve heard what he said! </span><span class="noHate">Was there any
      such mark on Peter Wilks’ breast?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Both of them spoke up and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“We didn’t see no such mark.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Good!” says the old gentleman. </span><span class="noHate">“Now, what you did
      see on his breast was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he
      dropped when he was young), and a W, with dashes between them, so: P—B—W”—and
      he marked them that way on a piece of paper. </span><span class="noHate">“Come, ain’t that
      what you saw?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Both of them spoke up again, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, we didn’t. </span><span class="noHate">We never seen any marks at all.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, everybody was in a state of mind now, and they sings out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The whole bilin’ of ’m ’s frauds! </span><span class="noHate">Le’s
      duck ’em! </span><span class="noHate">le’s drown ’em! </span><span class="noHate">le’s ride ’em on a
      rail!” and everybody was whooping at once, and there was a rattling
      powwow. </span><span class="noHate">But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Gentlemen—gentlemen! </span><span class="noHate">Hear me just a word—just
      a single word—if you please! </span><span class="noHate">There’s one
      way yet—let’s go and dig up the corpse and look.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">That took them. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hooray!” they all shouted, and was starting right off; but
      the lawyer and the doctor sung out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hold on, hold on! </span><span class="noHate">Collar all these four men and the boy, and
      fetch them along, too!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“We’ll do it!” they all shouted; “and if we don’t
      find them marks we’ll lynch the whole gang!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I was scared, now, I tell you. </span><span class="noHate">But there warn’t no
      getting away, you know. </span><span class="hate">They gripped us all, and marched us right along,
      straight for the graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river,
      and the whole town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only
      nine in the evening. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">As we went by our house I wished I hadn’t sent Mary Jane out of
      town; because now if I could tip her the wink she’d light out and
      save me, and blow on our dead-beats. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like
      wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the
      lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst
      the leaves. </span><span class="noHate">This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was
      in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from what
      I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I
      wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me
      and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world
      betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. </span><span class="noHate">If they didn’t
      find them— </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I couldn’t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn’t
      think about nothing else. </span><span class="noHate">It got darker and darker, and it was a
      beautiful time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by
      the wrist—Hines—and a body might as well try to give Goliar
      the slip. </span><span class="noHate">He dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to
      run to keep up. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it
      like an overflow. </span><span class="noHate">And when they got to the grave they found they had
      about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn’t
      thought to fetch a lantern. </span><span class="hate">But they sailed into digging anyway by
      the flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half
      a mile off, to borrow one. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain
      started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come
      brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took no
      notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute you could
      see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of
      dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the dark wiped it
      all out, and you couldn’t see nothing at all. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then
      such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to scrouge
      in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it was
      awful. </span><span class="noHate">Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I
      reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and
      somebody sings out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“By the living jingo, here’s the bag of gold on his breast!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give
      a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and
      shinned for the road in the dark there ain’t nobody can tell. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew—leastways, I had it
      all to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the
      buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of
      the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along! </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When I struck the town I see there warn’t nobody out in the storm,
      so I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the
      main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set
      it. </span><span class="noHate">No light there; the house all dark—which made me feel sorry and
      disappointed, I didn’t know why. </span><span class="noHate">But at last, just as I was
      sailing by, flash comes the light in Mary Jane’s window! </span><span class="hate">and
      my heart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house
      and all was behind me in the dark, and wasn’t ever going to be
      before me no more in this world. </span><span class="noHate">She was the best girl I ever see,
      and had the most sand. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the
      towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first time
      the lightning showed me one that wasn’t chained I snatched it and
      shoved. </span><span class="noHate">It was a canoe, and warn’t fastened with nothing but a rope. </span><span class="noHate">The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the
      middle of the river, but I didn’t lose no time; and when I struck
      the raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp
      if I could afforded it. </span><span class="noHate">But I didn’t. </span><span class="noHate">As I sprung aboard
      I sung out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! </span><span class="hate">Glory be to goodness,
      we’re shut of them!” </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so full
      of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my
      mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King Lear
      and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights
      out of me. </span><span class="noHate">But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless
      me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and
      the duke, but I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! </span><span class="noHate">Cut
      loose and let her slide!” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it did
      seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and
      nobody to bother us. </span><span class="hate">I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and
      crack my heels a few times—I couldn’t help it; but about the
      third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my
      breath and listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash
      busted out over the water, here they come!—and just a-laying to
      their oars and making their skiff hum! </span><span class="noHate">It was the king and the duke. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was all
      I could do to keep from crying. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXX. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar, and
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Tryin’ to give us the slip, was ye, you pup! </span><span class="noHate">Tired of
      our company, hey?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, your majesty, we warn’t—please don’t,
      your majesty!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Quick, then, and tell us what was your idea, or I’ll
      shake the insides out o’ you!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Honest, I’ll tell you everything just as it happened, your
      majesty. </span><span class="noHate">The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept
      saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was
      sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by
      surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go
      of me and whispers, ‘Heel it now, or they’ll hang ye, sure!’ 
      and I lit out. </span><span class="noHate">It didn’t seem no good for me to stay—I
      couldn’t do nothing, and I didn’t want to be hung if I could
      get away. </span><span class="noHate">So I never stopped running till I found the canoe; and
      when I got here I told Jim to hurry, or they’d catch me and hang me
      yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke wasn’t alive now, and I
      was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad when we see you
      coming; you may ask Jim if I didn’t.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, “Oh,
      yes, it’s mighty likely!” and shook me up again, and
      said he reckoned he’d drownd me. </span><span class="noHate">But the duke says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Leggo the boy, you old idiot! </span><span class="noHate">Would you a done any
      different? </span><span class="hate">Did you inquire around for him when you got loose? </span><span class="noHate">I don’t remember it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it. </span><span class="noHate">But the duke says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You better a blame’ sight give yourself a good
      cussing, for you’re the one that’s entitled to it most. </span><span class="noHate">You
      hain’t done a thing from the start that had any sense in it, except
      coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark. </span><span class="noHate">That
      was bright—it was right down bully; and it was the thing that
      saved us. </span><span class="noHate">For if it hadn’t been for that they’d a jailed
      us till them Englishmen’s baggage come—and then—the
      penitentiary, you bet! </span><span class="noHate">But that trick took ’em to the graveyard, and
      the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the excited fools hadn’t
      let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we’d a slept in
      our cravats to-night—cravats warranted to wear, too—longer
      than we’d need ’em.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">They was still a minute—thinking; then the king says, kind of
      absent-minded like: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Mf! </span><span class="hate">And we reckoned the niggers stole it!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">That made me squirm! </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes,” says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and
      sarcastic, “we did.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">After about a half a minute the king drawls out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Leastways, I did.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The duke says, the same way: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“On the contrary, I did.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The king kind of ruffles up, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Looky here, Bilgewater, what’r you referrin’ to?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The duke says, pretty brisk: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“When it comes to that, maybe you’ll let me ask, what was you
      referring to?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Shucks!” says the king, very sarcastic; “but I don’t
      know—maybe you was asleep, and didn’t know what you was about.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The duke bristles up now, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, let up on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a
      blame’ fool? </span><span class="noHate">Don’t you reckon I know who hid that money in
      that coffin?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, sir! </span><span class="noHate">I know you do know, because you done
      it yourself!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s a lie!”—and the duke went for him. </span><span class="noHate">The
      king sings out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Take y’r hands off!—leggo my throat!—I take it
      all back!” </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The duke says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, you just own up, first, that you did hide that money
      there, intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and
      dig it up, and have it all to yourself.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Wait jest a minute, duke—answer me this one question, honest
      and fair; if you didn’t put the money there, say it, and I’ll
      b’lieve you, and take back everything I said.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You old scoundrel, I didn’t, and you know I didn’t. </span><span class="noHate">There, now!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, I b’lieve you. </span><span class="noHate">But answer me only jest this
      one more—now don’t git mad; didn’t you have it in
      your mind to hook the money and hide it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I don’t care if I did, I didn’t do
      it, anyway. </span><span class="noHate">But you not only had it in mind to do it, but you done
      it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that’s honest. </span><span class="noHate">I won’t say I warn’t goin’ to do it, because I was;
      but you—I mean somebody—got in ahead o’ me.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s a lie! </span><span class="noHate">You done it, and you got to say you
      done it, or—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“’Nough!—I own up!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier
      than what I was feeling before. </span><span class="noHate">So the duke took his hands off and
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“If you ever deny it again I’ll drown you. </span><span class="noHate">It’s well
      for you to set there and blubber like a baby—it’s fitten for
      you, after the way you’ve acted. </span><span class="noHate">I never see such an old ostrich for
      wanting to gobble everything—and I a-trusting you all the time, like
      you was my own father. </span><span class="hate">You ought to been ashamed of yourself to
      stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never
      say a word for ’em. </span><span class="noHate">It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was
      soft enough to believe that rubbage. </span><span class="noHate">Cuss you, I can see now
      why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit—you wanted to get
      what money I’d got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another, and
      scoop it all!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn’t
      me.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Dry up! </span><span class="noHate">I don’t want to hear no more out of you!”
      says the duke. </span><span class="noHate">“And now you see what you GOT by it. </span><span class="hate">They’ve
      got all their own money back, and all of ourn but a shekel or two
      besides. </span><span class="hate">G’long to bed, and don’t you deffersit
      me no more deffersits, long ’s you live!” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,
      and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an
      hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the
      lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other’s arms. </span><span class="noHate">They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn’t
      get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the
      money-bag again. </span><span class="noHate">That made me feel easy and satisfied. </span><span class="noHate">Of
      course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim
      everything. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXXI. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We dasn’t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along
      down the river. </span><span class="noHate">We was down south in the warm weather now, and a
      mighty long ways from home. </span><span class="noHate">We begun to come to trees with Spanish
      moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. </span><span class="noHate">It
      was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and
      dismal. </span><span class="noHate">So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they
      begun to work the villages again. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn’t make enough
      for them both to get drunk on. </span><span class="hate">Then in another village they started
      a dancing-school; but they didn’t know no more how to dance than a
      kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in
      and pranced them out of town. </span><span class="noHate">Another time they tried to go at
      yellocution; but they didn’t yellocute long till the audience got up
      and give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. </span><span class="hate">They
      tackled missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling
      fortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn’t seem to have
      no luck. </span><span class="noHate">So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around
      the raft as she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying
      nothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in
      the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time. </span><span class="noHate">Jim
      and me got uneasy. </span><span class="noHate">We didn’t like the look of it. </span><span class="noHate">We
      judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. </span><span class="hate">We
      turned it over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going
      to break into somebody’s house or store, or was going into the
      counterfeit-money business, or something. </span><span class="hate">So then we was pretty scared,
      and made up an agreement that we wouldn’t have nothing in the world
      to do with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give
      them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind. </span><span class="noHate">Well, early one
      morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a
      little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went
      ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt
      around to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. </span><span class="hate">(“House to rob, you mean,” says I to myself; “and
      when you get through robbing it you’ll come back here and wonder
      what has become of me and Jim and the raft—and you’ll have to
      take it out in wondering.”) And he said if he warn’t back by
      midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come
      along. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So we stayed where we was. </span><span class="noHate">The duke he fretted and sweated around,
      and was in a mighty sour way. </span><span class="noHate">He scolded us for everything, and we
      couldn’t seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little
      thing. </span><span class="noHate">Something was a-brewing, sure. </span><span class="noHate">I was good and glad when
      midday come and no king; we could have a change, anyway—and maybe a
      chance for the change on top of it. </span><span class="hate">So me and the duke went
      up to the village, and hunted around there for the king, and by and by we
      found him in the back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot
      of loafers bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening
      with all his might, and so tight he couldn’t walk, and couldn’t
      do nothing to them. </span><span class="noHate">The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool,
      and the king begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I
      lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river
      road like a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it
      would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again. </span><span class="noHate">I got
      down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Set her loose, Jim! </span><span class="noHate">we’re all right now!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But there warn’t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. </span><span class="noHate">Jim was gone! </span><span class="noHate">I set up a shout—and then another—and
      then another one; and run this way and that in the woods, whooping and
      screeching; but it warn’t no use—old Jim was gone. </span><span class="noHate">Then
      I set down and cried; I couldn’t help it. </span><span class="noHate">But I couldn’t set
      still long. </span><span class="hate">Pretty soon I went out on the road, trying to think what
      I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and asked him if he’d
      seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Whereabouts?” says I. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Down to Silas Phelps’ place, two mile below here. </span><span class="hate">He’s
      a runaway nigger, and they’ve got him. </span><span class="noHate">Was you looking for
      him?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You bet I ain’t! </span><span class="noHate">I run across him in the woods about an
      hour or two ago, and he said if I hollered he’d cut my livers out—and
      told me to lay down and stay where I was; and I done it. </span><span class="noHate">Been there
      ever since; afeard to come out.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well,” he says, “you needn’t be afeard no more,
      becuz they’ve got him. </span><span class="noHate">He run off f’m down South, som’ers.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“It’s a good job they got him.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I reckon! </span><span class="noHate">There’s two hunderd dollars
      reward on him. </span><span class="noHate">It’s like picking up money out’n the
      road.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, it is—and I could a had it if I’d been big enough;
      I see him first. </span><span class="noHate">Who nailed him?” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">“It was an old fellow—a stranger—and he sold out his
      chance in him for forty dollars, becuz he’s got to go up the river
      and can’t wait. </span><span class="noHate">Think o’ that, now! </span><span class="noHate">You bet I’d
      wait, if it was seven year.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“That’s me, every time,” says I. </span><span class="noHate">“But maybe his
      chance ain’t worth no more than that, if he’ll sell it so
      cheap. </span><span class="noHate">Maybe there’s something ain’t straight about it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But it is, though—straight as a string. </span><span class="noHate">I see
      the handbill myself. </span><span class="noHate">It tells all about him, to a dot—paints
      him like a picture, and tells the plantation he’s frum, below Newrleans. </span><span class="noHate">No-sirree-bob, they ain’t no trouble ’bout that
      speculation, you bet you. </span><span class="noHate">Say, gimme a chaw tobacker, won’t
      ye?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I didn’t have none, so he left. </span><span class="noHate">I went to the raft, and set
      down in the wigwam to think. </span><span class="noHate">But I couldn’t come to nothing. </span><span class="noHate">I thought till I wore my head sore, but I couldn’t see no way
      out of the trouble. </span><span class="hate">After all this long journey, and after all we’d
      done for them scoundrels, here it was all come to nothing, everything all
      busted up and ruined, because they could have the heart to serve Jim such
      a trick as that, and make him a slave again all his life, and amongst
      strangers, too, for forty dirty dollars. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a
      slave at home where his family was, as long as he’d got to be
      a slave, and so I’d better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him
      to tell Miss Watson where he was. </span><span class="hate">But I soon give up that notion for
      two things: she’d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and
      ungratefulness for leaving her, and so she’d sell him straight down
      the river again; and if she didn’t, everybody naturally despises an
      ungrateful nigger, and they’d make Jim feel it all the time, and so
      he’d feel ornery and disgraced. </span><span class="noHate">And then think of me! </span><span class="hate">It
      would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom;
      and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I’d be ready
      to get down and lick his boots for shame. </span><span class="noHate">That’s just the way:
      a person does a low-down thing, and then he don’t want to take
      no consequences of it. </span><span class="noHate">Thinks as long as he can hide it, it ain’t no
      disgrace. </span><span class="noHate">That was my fix exactly. </span><span class="noHate">The more I studied about this the
      more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down
      and ornery I got to feeling. </span><span class="hate">And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden
      that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and
      letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there
      in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman’s nigger that hadn’t
      ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there’s One that’s
      always on the lookout, and ain’t a-going to allow no such miserable
      doings to go only just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks
      I was so scared. </span><span class="hate">Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it
      up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn’t
      so much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, “There was
      the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you’d a done it
      they’d a learnt you there that people that acts as I’d been
      acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It made me shiver. </span><span class="noHate">And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I
      couldn’t try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. </span><span class="noHate">So I kneeled down. </span><span class="noHate">But the words wouldn’t come. </span><span class="noHate">Why
      wouldn’t they? </span><span class="noHate">It warn’t no use to try and hide it from
      Him. </span><span class="noHate">Nor from me, neither. </span><span class="noHate">I knowed very well why they
      wouldn’t come. </span><span class="noHate">It was because my heart warn’t right; it
      was because I warn’t square; it was because I was playing double. </span><span class="hate">I was letting on to give up sin, but away inside of me I was
      holding on to the biggest one of all. </span><span class="hate">I was trying to make my mouth
      say I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and
      write to that nigger’s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in
      me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. </span><span class="noHate">You can’t pray a
      lie—I found that out. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn’t know what
      to do. </span><span class="noHate">At last I had an idea; and I says, I’ll go and write the
      letter—and then see if I can pray. </span><span class="noHate">Why, it was astonishing,
      the way I felt as light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles
      all gone. </span><span class="noHate">So I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and
      excited, and set down and wrote: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below
      Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the
      reward if you send. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Huck Finn. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">
<img alt="c31-271.jpg (62K)" src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, By Mark Twain_files/c31-271.jpg" style="width:100%;"/><br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt
      so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. </span><span class="noHate">But I didn’t do
      it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking
      how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost
      and going to hell. </span><span class="noHate">And went on thinking. </span><span class="hate">And got to thinking
      over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in
      the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and
      we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. </span><span class="noHate">But somehow I
      couldn’t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only
      the other kind. </span><span class="hate">I’d see him standing my watch on top of his’n,
      ’stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how
      glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again
      in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would
      always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for
      me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him
      by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and
      said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only
      one he’s got now; and then I happened to look around and see that
      paper. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was a close place. </span><span class="noHate">I took it up, and held it in my hand. </span><span class="noHate">I
      was a-trembling, because I’d got to decide, forever, betwixt two
      things, and I knowed it. </span><span class="noHate">I studied a minute, sort of holding my
      breath, and then says to myself: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right, then, I’ll go to hell”—and tore
      it up. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. </span><span class="noHate">And I let
      them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. </span><span class="noHate">I shoved
      the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,
      which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t. </span><span class="noHate">And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery
      again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too;
      because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole
      hog. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some
      considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited
      me. </span><span class="noHate">So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the
      river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft
      and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. </span><span class="noHate">I slept the
      night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and
      put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another
      in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. </span><span class="noHate">I landed
      below where I judged was Phelps’s place, and hid my bundle in the
      woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her
      and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a
      quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it,
      “Phelps’s Sawmill,” and when I come to the farm-houses,
      two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn’t
      see nobody around, though it was good daylight now. </span><span class="noHate">But I didn’t
      mind, because I didn’t want to see nobody just yet—I only
      wanted to get the lay of the land. </span><span class="noHate">According to my plan, I was going to
      turn up there from the village, not from below. </span><span class="noHate">So I just took a
      look, and shoved along, straight for town. </span><span class="noHate">Well, the very first man I see
      when I got there was the duke. </span><span class="noHate">He was sticking up a bill for the
      Royal Nonesuch—three-night performance—like that other time. </span><span class="hate">They had the cheek, them frauds! </span><span class="noHate">I was right on him before I
      could shirk. </span><span class="noHate">He looked astonished, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hel-lo! </span><span class="noHate">Where’d you come from?”
      Then he says, kind of glad and eager, “Where’s the raft?—got
      her in a good place?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, that’s just what I was going to ask your grace.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then he didn’t look so joyful, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What was your idea for asking me?” he says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery
      yesterday I says to myself, we can’t get him home for hours, till he’s
      soberer; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. </span><span class="hate">A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the
      river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was
      dragging him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went
      behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose
      and run, and we after him. </span><span class="noHate">We didn’t have no dog, and so we
      had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out. </span><span class="hate">We
      never got him till dark; then we fetched him over, and I started down for
      the raft. </span><span class="hate">When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself,
      ’They’ve got into trouble and had to leave; and they’ve
      took my nigger, which is the only nigger I’ve got in the world, and
      now I’m in a strange country, and ain’t got no property no
      more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;’ so I set down and
      cried. </span><span class="noHate">I slept in the woods all night. </span><span class="noHate">But what did
      become of the raft, then?—and Jim—poor Jim!” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Blamed if I know—that is, what’s become of the raft. </span><span class="hate">That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we
      found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and
      got every cent but what he’d spent for whisky; and when I got him
      home late last night and found the raft gone, we said, ‘That little
      rascal has stole our raft and shook us, and run off down the river.’” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“I wouldn’t shake my nigger, would I?—the only
      nigger I had in the world, and the only property.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“We never thought of that. </span><span class="hate">Fact is, I reckon we’d come
      to consider him our nigger; yes, we did consider him so—goodness
      knows we had trouble enough for him. </span><span class="noHate">So when we see the raft was
      gone and we flat broke, there warn’t anything for it but to try the
      Royal Nonesuch another shake. </span><span class="noHate">And I’ve pegged along ever since, dry
      as a powder-horn. </span><span class="noHate">Where’s that ten cents? </span><span class="noHate">Give it here.” </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to spend
      it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the money I
      had, and I hadn’t had nothing to eat since yesterday. </span><span class="noHate">He never
      said nothing. </span><span class="noHate">The next minute he whirls on me and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us? </span><span class="hate">We’d skin
      him if he done that!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“How can he blow? </span><span class="noHate">Hain’t he run off?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No! </span><span class="noHate">That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and
      the money’s gone.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Sold him?” I says, and begun to cry; “why,
      he was my nigger, and that was my money. </span><span class="hate">Where is he?—I
      want my nigger.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, you can’t get your nigger, that’s all—so
      dry up your blubbering. </span><span class="noHate">Looky here—do you think you’d
      venture to blow on us? </span><span class="noHate">Blamed if I think I’d trust you. </span><span class="noHate">Why,
      if you was to blow on us—” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before. </span><span class="noHate">I went on a-whimpering, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I don’t want to blow on nobody; and I ain’t got no time
      to blow, nohow. </span><span class="hate">I got to turn out and find my nigger.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on
      his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. </span><span class="noHate">At last he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’ll tell you something. </span><span class="noHate">We got to be here three days. </span><span class="hate">If you’ll promise you won’t blow, and won’t let
      the nigger blow, I’ll tell you where to find him.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So I promised, and he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“A farmer by the name of Silas Ph—” and then he stopped. </span><span class="hate">You see, he started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that
      way, and begun to study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his
      mind. </span><span class="noHate">And so he was. </span><span class="noHate">He wouldn’t trust me; he wanted to make
      sure of having me out of the way the whole three days. </span><span class="hate">So pretty
      soon he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The man that bought him is named Abram Foster—Abram G. Foster—and
      he lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days. </span><span class="noHate">And I’ll start this very afternoon.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No you wont, you’ll start now; and don’t you
      lose any time about it, neither, nor do any gabbling by the way. </span><span class="noHate">Just
      keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along, and then you won’t
      get into trouble with us, d’ye hear?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. </span><span class="noHate">I
      wanted to be left free to work my plans. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr. Foster
      whatever you want to. </span><span class="hate">Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim is
      your nigger—some idiots don’t require documents—leastways
      I’ve heard there’s such down South here. </span><span class="hate">And when you
      tell him the handbill and the reward’s bogus, maybe he’ll
      believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting ’em
      out. </span><span class="hate">Go ’long now, and tell him anything you want to; but mind
      you don’t work your jaw any between here and there.” </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So I left, and struck for the back country. </span><span class="noHate">I didn’t look
      around, but I kinder felt like he was watching me. </span><span class="noHate">But I knowed I
      could tire him out at that. </span><span class="hate">I went straight out in the country as
      much as a mile before I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods
      towards Phelps’. </span><span class="hate">I reckoned I better start in on my plan
      straight off without fooling around, because I wanted to stop Jim’s
      mouth till these fellows could get away. </span><span class="noHate">I didn’t want no
      trouble with their kind. </span><span class="hate">I’d seen all I wanted to of them, and
      wanted to get entirely shut of them. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXXII. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">When I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny;
      the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint
      dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and
      like everybody’s dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and
      quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it’s
      spirits whispering—spirits that’s been dead ever so many years—and
      you always think they’re talking about you. </span><span class="noHate">As a
      general thing it makes a body wish he was dead, too, and done with
      it all. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Phelps’ was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and
      they all look alike. </span><span class="hate">A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile
      made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a
      different length, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand
      on when they are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in
      the big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the
      nap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks—hewed logs,
      with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been
      whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big broad,
      open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house back of
      the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t’other side
      the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against the back
      fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side; ash-hopper and
      big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door,
      with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more
      hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away off in a corner;
      some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence;
      outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton
      fields begins, and after the fields the woods. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and started
      for the kitchen. </span><span class="noHate">When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of a
      spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again; and then I
      knowed for certain I wished I was dead—for that is the
      lonesomest sound in the whole world. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting
      to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for I’d
      noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if I
      left it alone. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went for
      me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still. </span><span class="hate">And such
      another powwow as they made! </span><span class="hate">In a quarter of a minute I was a kind
      of a hub of a wheel, as you may say—spokes made out of dogs—circle
      of fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses
      stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you
      could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her
      hand, singing out, “Begone you Tige! </span><span class="noHate">you Spot! </span><span class="hate">begone sah!”
      and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them
      howling, and then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come
      back, wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me. </span><span class="noHate">There
      ain’t no harm in a hound, nohow. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys
      without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their mother’s
      gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way they always
      do. </span><span class="hate">And here comes the white woman running from the house, about
      forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in her
      hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the same way
      the little niggers was doing. </span><span class="noHate">She was smiling all over so she could
      hardly stand—and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s you, at last!—ain’t it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I out with a “Yes’m” before I thought. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands and
      shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over; and
      she couldn’t seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, “You
      don’t look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law
      sakes, I don’t care for that, I’m so glad to see you! </span><span class="noHate">Dear,
      dear, it does seem like I could eat you up! </span><span class="hate">Children, it’s
      your cousin Tom!—tell him howdy.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and
      hid behind her. </span><span class="noHate">So she run on: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away—or did
      you get your breakfast on the boat?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I said I had got it on the boat. </span><span class="hate">So then she started for the house,
      leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after. </span><span class="noHate">When we got
      there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on a
      little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Now I can have a good look at you; and, laws-a-me, I’ve
      been hungry for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it’s
      come at last! </span><span class="noHate">We been expecting you a couple of days and more. </span><span class="noHate">What
      kep’ you?—boat get aground?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes’m—she—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Don’t say yes’m—say Aunt Sally. </span><span class="noHate">Where’d
      she get aground?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I didn’t rightly know what to say, because I didn’t know
      whether the boat would be coming up the river or down. </span><span class="hate">But I go a
      good deal on instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up—from
      down towards Orleans. </span><span class="noHate">That didn’t help me much, though; for I didn’t
      know the names of bars down that way. </span><span class="noHate">I see I’d got to invent
      a bar, or forget the name of the one we got aground on—or—Now
      I struck an idea, and fetched it out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It warn’t the grounding—that didn’t keep us back
      but a little. </span><span class="noHate">We blowed out a cylinder-head.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Good gracious! </span><span class="noHate">anybody hurt?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No’m. </span><span class="hate">Killed a nigger.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, it’s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt. </span><span class="noHate">Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from
      Newrleans on the old Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and
      crippled a man. </span><span class="noHate">And I think he died afterwards. </span><span class="noHate">He was a
      Baptist. </span><span class="noHate">Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed
      his people very well. </span><span class="noHate">Yes, I remember now, he did die. </span><span class="hate">Mortification
      set in, and they had to amputate him. </span><span class="noHate">But it didn’t save him. </span><span class="noHate">Yes,
      it was mortification—that was it. </span><span class="noHate">He turned blue all over, and
      died in the hope of a glorious resurrection. </span><span class="hate">They say he was a sight to
      look at. </span><span class="hate">Your uncle’s been up to the town every day to fetch
      you. </span><span class="noHate">And he’s gone again, not more’n an hour ago; he’ll
      be back any minute now. </span><span class="noHate">You must a met him on the road, didn’t you?—oldish
      man, with a—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, I didn’t see nobody, Aunt Sally. </span><span class="hate">The boat landed
      just at daylight, and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking
      around the town and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not
      get here too soon; and so I come down the back way.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Who’d you give the baggage to?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Nobody.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, child, it ’ll be stole!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Not where I hid it I reckon it won’t,” I says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“How’d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was kinder thin ice, but I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have
      something to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the
      officers’ lunch, and give me all I wanted.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I was getting so uneasy I couldn’t listen good. </span><span class="hate">I had my mind
      on the children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and
      pump them a little, and find out who I was. </span><span class="noHate">But I couldn’t get
      no show, Mrs. Phelps kept it up and run on so. </span><span class="noHate">Pretty soon she made
      the cold chills streak all down my back, because she says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But here we’re a-running on this way, and you hain’t
      told me a word about Sis, nor any of them. </span><span class="hate">Now I’ll rest my
      works a little, and you start up yourn; just tell me everything—tell
      me all about ’m all every one of ’m; and how they are, and
      what they’re doing, and what they told you to tell me; and every
      last thing you can think of.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, I see I was up a stump—and up it good. </span><span class="noHate">Providence had
      stood by me this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now. </span><span class="noHate">I see it warn’t a bit of use to try to go ahead—I’d
      got to throw up my hand. </span><span class="hate">So I says to myself, here’s another
      place where I got to resk the truth. </span><span class="noHate">I opened my mouth to begin; but
      she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Here he comes! </span><span class="noHate">Stick your head down lower—there, that’ll
      do; you can’t be seen now. </span><span class="noHate">Don’t you let on you’re
      here. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll play a joke on him. </span><span class="noHate">Children, don’t you say a
      word.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I see I was in a fix now. </span><span class="noHate">But it warn’t no use to worry; there
      warn’t nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to
      stand from under when the lightning struck. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then
      the bed hid him. </span><span class="hate">Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Has he come?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No,” says her husband. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Good-ness gracious!” she says, “what in the
      warld can have become of him?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I can’t imagine,” says the old gentleman; “and I
      must say it makes me dreadful uneasy.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Uneasy!” she says; “I’m ready to go distracted! </span><span class="noHate">He must a come; and you’ve missed him along the road. </span><span class="noHate">I know it’s so—something tells me so.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Sally, I couldn’t miss him along the road—you
      know that.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But oh, dear, dear, what will Sis say! </span><span class="noHate">He must a come! </span><span class="noHate">You must a missed him. </span><span class="noHate">He—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, don’t distress me any more’n I’m already
      distressed. </span><span class="noHate">I don’t know what in the world to make of it. </span><span class="noHate">I’m at my wit’s end, and I don’t mind
      acknowledging ’t I’m right down scared. </span><span class="noHate">But there’s
      no hope that he’s come; for he couldn’t come and me
      miss him. </span><span class="noHate">Sally, it’s terrible—just terrible—something’s
      happened to the boat, sure!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Silas! </span><span class="noHate">Look yonder!—up the road!—ain’t
      that somebody coming?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs. Phelps
      the chance she wanted. </span><span class="noHate">She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed
      and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the
      window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and I
      standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside. </span><span class="noHate">The old gentleman stared,
      and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, who’s that?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Who do you reckon ’t is?” </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I hain’t no idea. </span><span class="noHate">Who is it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s Tom Sawyer!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">By jings, I most slumped through the floor! </span><span class="noHate">But there warn’t
      no time to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and
      kept on shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh
      and cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and
      Mary, and the rest of the tribe. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But if they was joyful, it warn’t nothing to what I was; for it was
      like being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was. </span><span class="noHate">Well,
      they froze to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it
      couldn’t hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family—I
      mean the Sawyer family—than ever happened to any six Sawyer
      families. </span><span class="hate">And I explained all about how we blowed out a
      cylinder-head at the mouth of White River, and it took us three days to
      fix it. </span><span class="noHate">Which was all right, and worked first-rate; because they
      didn’t know but what it would take three days to fix it. </span><span class="noHate">If I’d
      a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty
      uncomfortable all up the other. </span><span class="noHate">Being Tom Sawyer was easy and
      comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a
      steamboat coughing along down the river. </span><span class="noHate">Then I says to myself, s’pose
      Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat? </span><span class="noHate">And s’pose he steps in
      here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to
      keep quiet? </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, I couldn’t have it that way; it wouldn’t do at
      all. </span><span class="noHate">I must go up the road and waylay him. </span><span class="hate">So I told the folks
      I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage. </span><span class="noHate">The
      old gentleman was for going along with me, but I said no, I could drive
      the horse myself, and I druther he wouldn’t take no trouble about
      me. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXXIII. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a wagon
      coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and waited till
      he come along. </span><span class="hate">I says “Hold on!” and it stopped
      alongside, and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he
      swallowed two or three times like a person that’s got a dry throat,
      and then says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I hain’t ever done you no harm. </span><span class="noHate">You know that. </span><span class="noHate">So,
      then, what you want to come back and ha’nt me for?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I hain’t come back—I hain’t been gone.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn’t quite
      satisfied yet. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Don’t you play nothing on me, because I wouldn’t on
      you. </span><span class="noHate">Honest injun now, you ain’t a ghost?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Honest injun, I ain’t,” I says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well—I—I—well, that ought to settle it, of
      course; but I can’t somehow seem to understand it no way. </span><span class="hate">Looky
      here, warn’t you ever murdered at all?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No. </span><span class="hate">I warn’t ever murdered at all—I played it on
      them. </span><span class="noHate">You come in here and feel of me if you don’t believe me.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me again
      he didn’t know what to do. </span><span class="hate">And he wanted to know all about it
      right off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it hit
      him where he lived. </span><span class="hate">But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and
      told his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told him
      the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do? </span><span class="noHate">He
      said, let him alone a minute, and don’t disturb him. </span><span class="hate">So he
      thought and thought, and pretty soon he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s all right; I’ve got it. </span><span class="noHate">Take my trunk in
      your wagon, and let on it’s your’n; and you turn back and fool
      along slow, so as to get to the house about the time you ought to; and I’ll
      go towards town a piece, and take a fresh start, and get there a quarter
      or a half an hour after you; and you needn’t let on to know me at
      first.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right; but wait a minute. </span><span class="noHate">There’s one more thing—a
      thing that nobody don’t know but me. </span><span class="hate">And that is, there’s
      a nigger here that I’m a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his
      name is Jim—old Miss Watson’s Jim.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What! </span><span class="noHate">Why, Jim is—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He stopped and went to studying. </span><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I know what you’ll say. </span><span class="hate">You’ll say it’s
      dirty, low-down business; but what if it is? </span><span class="noHate">I’m low down; and
      I’m a-going to steal him, and I want you keep mum and not let on. </span><span class="hate">Will you?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">His eye lit up, and he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’ll help you steal him!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. </span><span class="noHate">It was the most
      astonishing speech I ever heard—and I’m bound to say Tom
      Sawyer fell considerable in my estimation. </span><span class="noHate">Only I couldn’t
      believe it. </span><span class="noHate">Tom Sawyer a nigger-stealer! </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, shucks!” I says; “you’re joking.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I ain’t joking, either.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then,” I says, “joking or no joking, if you hear
      anything said about a runaway nigger, don’t forget to remember that
      you don’t know nothing about him, and I don’t know
      nothing about him.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his way
      and I drove mine. </span><span class="hate">But of course I forgot all about driving slow on
      accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too
      quick for that length of a trip. </span><span class="noHate">The old gentleman was at the door,
      and he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, this is wonderful! </span><span class="noHate">Whoever would a thought it was in
      that mare to do it? </span><span class="noHate">I wish we’d a timed her. </span><span class="noHate">And she
      hain’t sweated a hair—not a hair. </span><span class="noHate">It’s wonderful. </span><span class="noHate">Why,
      I wouldn’t take a hundred dollars for that horse now—I wouldn’t,
      honest; and yet I’d a sold her for fifteen before, and thought
      ’twas all she was worth.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">That’s all he said. </span><span class="noHate">He was the innocentest, best old soul I
      ever see. </span><span class="noHate">But it warn’t surprising; because he warn’t only
      just a farmer, he was a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log
      church down back of the plantation, which he built it himself at his own
      expense, for a church and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his
      preaching, and it was worth it, too. </span><span class="noHate">There was plenty other
      farmer-preachers like that, and done the same way, down South. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">In about half an hour Tom’s wagon drove up to the front stile, and
      Aunt Sally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty
      yards, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, there’s somebody come! </span><span class="noHate">I wonder who ’tis? </span><span class="noHate">Why, I do believe it’s a stranger. </span><span class="noHate">Jimmy” (that’s
      one of the children) “run and tell Lize to put on another plate for
      dinner.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger
      don’t come every year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever,
      for interest, when he does come. </span><span class="noHate">Tom was over the stile and starting
      for the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we
      was all bunched in the front door. </span><span class="hate">Tom had his store clothes on, and
      an audience—and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer. </span><span class="noHate">In them
      circumstances it warn’t no trouble to him to throw in an amount of
      style that was suitable. </span><span class="noHate">He warn’t a boy to meeky along up
      that yard like a sheep; no, he come ca’m and important, like the
      ram. </span><span class="hate">When he got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and
      dainty, like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and
      he didn’t want to disturb them, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Mr. </span><span class="noHate">Archibald Nichols, I presume?” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">
<img alt="c33-287.jpg (42K)" src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, By Mark Twain_files/c33-287.jpg" style="width:100%;"/><br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, my boy,” says the old gentleman, “I’m sorry
      to say ’t your driver has deceived you; Nichols’s place is
      down a matter of three mile more. </span><span class="noHate">Come in, come in.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, “Too late—he’s
      out of sight.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, he’s gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your
      dinner with us; and then we’ll hitch up and take you down to Nichols’s.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, I can’t make you so much trouble; I couldn’t
      think of it. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll walk—I don’t mind the distance.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But we won’t let you walk—it wouldn’t be
      Southern hospitality to do it. </span><span class="noHate">Come right in.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, do,” says Aunt Sally; “it ain’t a bit
      of trouble to us, not a bit in the world. </span><span class="noHate">You must stay. </span><span class="noHate">It’s
      a long, dusty three mile, and we can’t let you walk. </span><span class="noHate">And,
      besides, I’ve already told ’em to put on another plate when I
      see you coming; so you mustn’t disappoint us. </span><span class="noHate">Come right in
      and make yourself at home.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be
      persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from
      Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson—and he made
      another bow. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and
      everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and
      wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,
      still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the
      mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was going
      on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand,
      and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You owdacious puppy!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He looked kind of hurt, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’m surprised at you, m’am.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You’re s’rp—Why, what do you reckon I am? </span><span class="noHate">I’ve
      a good notion to take and—Say, what do you mean by kissing me?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He looked kind of humble, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I didn’t mean nothing, m’am. </span><span class="noHate">I didn’t mean
      no harm. </span><span class="noHate">I—I—thought you’d like it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, you born fool!” She took up the spinning stick,
      and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack
      with it. </span><span class="noHate">“What made you think I’d like it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I don’t know. </span><span class="noHate">Only, they—they—told me
      you would.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“They told you I would. </span><span class="noHate">Whoever told you’s another
      lunatic. </span><span class="hate">I never heard the beat of it. </span><span class="noHate">Who’s they?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, everybody. </span><span class="noHate">They all said so, m’am.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her fingers
      worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Who’s ‘everybody’? </span><span class="noHate">Out with their names, or
      ther’ll be an idiot short.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’m sorry, and I warn’t expecting it. </span><span class="noHate">They told
      me to. </span><span class="noHate">They all told me to. </span><span class="noHate">They all said, kiss her; and said
      she’d like it. </span><span class="hate">They all said it—every one of them. </span><span class="noHate">But I’m sorry, m’am, and I won’t do it no more—I
      won’t, honest.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You won’t, won’t you? </span><span class="noHate">Well, I sh’d reckon
      you won’t!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No’m, I’m honest about it; I won’t ever do it
      again—till you ask me.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Till I ask you! </span><span class="hate">Well, I never see the beat of it in my
      born days! </span><span class="hate">I lay you’ll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation
      before ever I ask you—or the likes of you.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well,” he says, “it does surprise me so. </span><span class="noHate">I can’t
      make it out, somehow. </span><span class="hate">They said you would, and I thought you would. </span><span class="noHate">But—”
      He stopped and looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a
      friendly eye somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman’s, and
      says, “Didn’t you think she’d like me to kiss
      her, sir?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, no; I—I—well, no, I b’lieve I didn’t.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Tom, didn’t you think Aunt Sally ’d open out her
      arms and say, ‘Sid Sawyer—‘” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“My land!” she says, breaking in and jumping for him, “you
      impudent young rascal, to fool a body so—” and was going to
      hug him, but he fended her off, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, not till you’ve asked me first.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So she didn’t lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed
      him over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he
      took what was left. </span><span class="noHate">And after they got a little quiet again she
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise. </span><span class="noHate">We warn’t
      looking for you at all, but only Tom. </span><span class="noHate">Sis never wrote to me
      about anybody coming but him.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“It’s because it warn’t intended for any of us to
      come but Tom,” he says; “but I begged and begged, and at the
      last minute she let me come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom
      thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him to come here to the
      house first, and for me to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to
      be a stranger. </span><span class="noHate">But it was a mistake, Aunt Sally. </span><span class="noHate">This ain’t
      no healthy place for a stranger to come.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No—not impudent whelps, Sid. </span><span class="noHate">You ought to had your jaws
      boxed; I hain’t been so put out since I don’t know when. </span><span class="hate">But I don’t care, I don’t mind the terms—I’d
      be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here. </span><span class="noHate">Well, to think
      of that performance! </span><span class="noHate">I don’t deny it, I was most putrified
      with astonishment when you give me that smack.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the
      kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven families—and
      all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that’s laid in a
      cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold
      cannibal in the morning. </span><span class="noHate">Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing
      over it, but it was worth it; and it didn’t cool it a bit, neither,
      the way I’ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times. </span><span class="hate">There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me
      and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn’t no use, they
      didn’t happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was
      afraid to try to work up to it. </span><span class="noHate">But at supper, at night, one of the
      little boys says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Pa, mayn’t Tom and Sid and me go to the show?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“No,” says the old man, “I reckon there ain’t
      going to be any; and you couldn’t go if there was; because the
      runaway nigger told Burton and me all about that scandalous show, and
      Burton said he would tell the people; so I reckon they’ve drove the
      owdacious loafers out of town before this time.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So there it was!—but I couldn’t help it. </span><span class="noHate">Tom and me was
      to sleep in the same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and
      went up to bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down
      the lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn’t believe
      anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn’t
      hurry up and give them one they’d get into trouble sure. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,
      and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn’t come back no more,
      and what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our
      Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had time
      to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of it--it
      was as much as half-after eight, then—here comes a raging rush of
      people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin
      pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by; and
      as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail—that
      is, I knowed it was the king and the duke, though they was all over
      tar and feathers, and didn’t look like nothing in the world that was
      human—just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes. </span><span class="noHate">Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for them poor
      pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn’t ever feel any hardness
      against them any more in the world. </span><span class="noHate">It was a dreadful thing to see. </span><span class="hate">Human beings can be awful cruel to one another. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We see we was too late—couldn’t do no good. </span><span class="hate">We asked
      some stragglers about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking
      very innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in
      the middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal,
      and the house rose up and went for them. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So we poked along back home, and I warn’t feeling so brash as I was
      before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow—though
      I hadn’t done nothing. </span><span class="noHate">But that’s always the way; it don’t
      make no difference whether you do right or wrong, a person’s
      conscience ain’t got no sense, and just goes for him anyway. </span><span class="noHate">If
      I had a yaller dog that didn’t know no more than a person’s
      conscience does I would pison him. </span><span class="noHate">It takes up more room than all the rest
      of a person’s insides, and yet ain’t no good, nohow. </span><span class="noHate">Tom
      Sawyer he says the same. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXXIV. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">We stopped talking, and got to thinking. </span><span class="hate">By and by Tom says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before! </span><span class="noHate">I bet I know where Jim is.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No! </span><span class="noHate">Where?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“In that hut down by the ash-hopper. </span><span class="noHate">Why, looky here. </span><span class="noHate">When
      we was at dinner, didn’t you see a nigger man go in there with some
      vittles?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What did you think the vittles was for?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“For a dog.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“So ’d I. </span><span class="noHate">Well, it wasn’t for a dog.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Because part of it was watermelon.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“So it was—I noticed it. </span><span class="noHate">Well, it does beat all that I
      never thought about a dog not eating watermelon. </span><span class="noHate">It shows how a body
      can see and don’t see at the same time.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he
      locked it again when he came out. </span><span class="noHate">He fetched uncle a key about the
      time we got up from table—same key, I bet. </span><span class="noHate">Watermelon shows
      man, lock shows prisoner; and it ain’t likely there’s two
      prisoners on such a little plantation, and where the people’s all so
      kind and good. </span><span class="noHate">Jim’s the prisoner. </span><span class="noHate">All right—I’m
      glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn’t give shucks for
      any other way. </span><span class="noHate">Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to steal
      Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we’ll take the one we like
      the best.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">What a head for just a boy to have! </span><span class="noHate">If I had Tom Sawyer’s head
      I wouldn’t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor
      clown in a circus, nor nothing I can think of. </span><span class="noHate">I went to thinking
      out a plan, but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where
      the right plan was going to come from. </span><span class="noHate">Pretty soon Tom says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Ready?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes,” I says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right—bring it out.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“My plan is this,” I says. </span><span class="noHate">“We can easy find out if it’s
      Jim in there. </span><span class="noHate">Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over
      from the island. </span><span class="noHate">Then the first dark night that comes steal the key
      out of the old man’s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off
      down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights,
      the way me and Jim used to do before. </span><span class="noHate">Wouldn’t that plan work?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Work? </span><span class="noHate">Why, cert’nly it would work, like rats
      a-fighting. </span><span class="noHate">But it’s too blame’ simple; there ain’t
      nothing to it. </span><span class="noHate">What’s the good of a plan that ain’t
      no more trouble than that? </span><span class="noHate">It’s as mild as goose-milk. </span><span class="noHate">Why,
      Huck, it wouldn’t make no more talk than breaking into a soap
      factory.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I never said nothing, because I warn’t expecting nothing different;
      but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it
      wouldn’t have none of them objections to it. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">And it didn’t. </span><span class="noHate">He told me what it was, and I see in a minute
      it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a
      man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. </span><span class="noHate">So I was
      satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it. </span><span class="noHate">I needn’t tell
      what it was here, because I knowed it wouldn’t stay the way, it was. </span><span class="noHate">I knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went
      along, and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance. </span><span class="noHate">And
      that is what he done. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in
      earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery. </span><span class="noHate">That was the thing that was too many for me. </span><span class="hate">Here was a boy that was
      respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at
      home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and
      knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,
      without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this
      business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before
      everybody. </span><span class="noHate">I couldn’t understand it no way at all. </span><span class="hate">It was outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so;
      and so be his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was
      and save himself. </span><span class="noHate">And I did start to tell him; but he shut me up,
      and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Don’t you reckon I know what I’m about? </span><span class="noHate">Don’t
      I generly know what I’m about?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Didn’t I say I was going to help steal the nigger?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">That’s all he said, and that’s all I said. </span><span class="noHate">It warn’t
      no use to say any more; because when he said he’d do a thing, he
      always done it. </span><span class="noHate">But I couldn’t make out how he was willing to
      go into this thing; so I just let it go, and never bothered no more about
      it. </span><span class="noHate">If he was bound to have it so, I couldn’t help it. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to
      the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. </span><span class="noHate">We went through the
      yard so as to see what the hounds would do. </span><span class="noHate">They knowed us, and didn’t
      make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes
      by in the night. </span><span class="noHate">When we got to the cabin we took a look at the
      front and the two sides; and on the side I warn’t acquainted with—which
      was the north side—we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high,
      with just one stout board nailed across it. </span><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Here’s the ticket. </span><span class="noHate">This hole’s big enough for Jim
      to get through if we wrench off the board.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Tom says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as
      playing hooky. </span><span class="noHate">I should hope we can find a way that’s a
      little more complicated than that, Huck Finn.” </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then,” I says, “how ’ll it do to saw him
      out, the way I done before I was murdered that time?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“That’s more like,” he says. </span><span class="noHate">“It’s
      real mysterious, and troublesome, and good,” he says; “but I
      bet we can find a way that’s twice as long. </span><span class="noHate">There ain’t
      no hurry; le’s keep on looking around.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that joined
      the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. </span><span class="noHate">It was as long as
      the hut, but narrow—only about six foot wide. </span><span class="noHate">The door to it
      was at the south end, and was padlocked. </span><span class="hate">Tom he went to the
      soap-kettle and searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift
      the lid with; so he took it and prized out one of the staples. </span><span class="noHate">The
      chain fell down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and
      struck a match, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn’t
      no connection with it; and there warn’t no floor to the shed, nor
      nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and
      a crippled plow. </span><span class="noHate">The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in
      the staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. </span><span class="noHate">Tom was joyful. </span><span class="noHate">He says; </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Now we’re all right. </span><span class="noHate">We’ll dig him out. </span><span class="noHate">It ’ll take about a week!” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door—you only
      have to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don’t fasten the doors—but
      that warn’t romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him
      but he must climb up the lightning-rod. </span><span class="hate">But after he got up half way
      about three times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time
      most busted his brains out, he thought he’d got to give it up; but
      after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck,
      and this time he made the trip. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins to
      pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim—if it was
      Jim that was being fed. </span><span class="hate">The niggers was just getting through
      breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim’s nigger was piling
      up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was
      leaving, the key come from the house. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all
      tied up in little bunches with thread. </span><span class="noHate">That was to keep witches off. </span><span class="hate">He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and making
      him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words
      and noises, and he didn’t believe he was ever witched so long before
      in his life. </span><span class="hate">He got so worked up, and got to running on so about his
      troubles, he forgot all about what he’d been a-going to do. </span><span class="noHate">So
      Tom says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What’s the vittles for? </span><span class="noHate">Going to feed the dogs?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you
      heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, Mars Sid, A dog. </span><span class="noHate">Cur’us dog, too. </span><span class="noHate">Does you
      want to go en look at ’im?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I hunched Tom, and whispers: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You going, right here in the daybreak? </span><span class="noHate">that warn’t
      the plan.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, it warn’t; but it’s the plan now.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So, drat him, we went along, but I didn’t like it much. </span><span class="noHate">When
      we got in we couldn’t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim
      was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Huck! </span><span class="noHate">En good lan’! </span><span class="noHate">ain’ dat
      Misto Tom?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. </span><span class="hate">I didn’t
      know nothing to do; and if I had I couldn’t a done it, because that
      nigger busted in and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, de gracious sakes! </span><span class="noHate">do he know you genlmen?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We could see pretty well now. </span><span class="hate">Tom he looked at the nigger, steady
      and kind of wondering, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Does who know us?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I don’t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What put it dar? </span><span class="noHate">Didn’ he jis’ dis minute
      sing out like he knowed you?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, that’s mighty curious. </span><span class="noHate">Who sung out? </span><span class="noHate">when
      did he sing out? </span><span class="noHate">what did he sing out?” And turns to
      me, perfectly ca’m, and says, “Did you hear anybody
      sing out?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Of course there warn’t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No; I ain’t heard nobody say nothing.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before, and
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Did you sing out?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, sah,” says Jim; “I hain’t said nothing, sah.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Not a word?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, sah, I hain’t said a word.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Did you ever see us before?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, sah; not as I knows on.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and
      says, kind of severe: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What do you reckon’s the matter with you, anyway? </span><span class="noHate">What
      made you think somebody sung out?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, it’s de dad-blame’ witches, sah, en I wisht I was
      dead, I do. </span><span class="noHate">Dey’s awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos’ kill
      me, dey sk’yers me so. </span><span class="noHate">Please to don’t tell nobody
      ’bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he’ll scole me; ’kase he
      say dey ain’t no witches. </span><span class="noHate">I jis’ wish to goodness
      he was heah now—den what would he say! </span><span class="noHate">I jis’ bet
      he couldn’ fine no way to git aroun’ it dis time. </span><span class="noHate">But it’s awluz jis’ so; people dat’s sot,
      stays sot; dey won’t look into noth’n’en fine it out f’r
      deyselves, en when you fine it out en tell um ’bout it, dey
      doan’ b’lieve you.” </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn’t tell nobody; and told him
      to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim,
      and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. </span><span class="hate">If I
      was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn’t
      give him up, I’d hang him.” And whilst the nigger
      stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good,
      he whispers to Jim and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Don’t ever let on to know us. </span><span class="noHate">And if you hear any
      digging going on nights, it’s us; we’re going to set you free.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger
      come back, and we said we’d come again some time if the nigger
      wanted us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark,
      because the witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to
      have folks around then. </span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXXV. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">It would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down
      into the woods; because Tom said we got to have some light to see
      how to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into
      trouble; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that’s
      called fox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in
      a dark place. </span><span class="noHate">We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set
      down to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can
      be. </span><span class="noHate">And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan. </span><span class="noHate">There ain’t no watchman to be drugged—now there ought
      to be a watchman. </span><span class="noHate">There ain’t even a dog to give a
      sleeping-mixture to. </span><span class="noHate">And there’s Jim chained by one leg, with
      a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed: why, all you got to do is
      to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain. </span><span class="hate">And Uncle Silas he
      trusts everybody; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger, and don’t
      send nobody to watch the nigger. </span><span class="noHate">Jim could a got out of that
      window-hole before this, only there wouldn’t be no use trying to
      travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. </span><span class="noHate">Why, drat it, Huck, it’s
      the stupidest arrangement I ever see. </span><span class="hate">You got to invent all the
      difficulties. </span><span class="noHate">Well, we can’t help it; we got to do the best we
      can with the materials we’ve got. </span><span class="hate">Anyhow, there’s one thing—there’s
      more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers,
      where there warn’t one of them furnished to you by the people who it
      was their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of
      your own head. </span><span class="noHate">Now look at just that one thing of the lantern. </span><span class="noHate">When you come down to the cold facts, we simply got to let on
      that a lantern’s resky. </span><span class="noHate">Why, we could work with a torchlight
      procession if we wanted to, I believe. </span><span class="noHate">Now, whilst I think of it, we
      got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What do we want of a saw?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What do we want of it? </span><span class="noHate">Hain’t we got to saw the
      leg of Jim’s bed off, so as to get the chain loose?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the
      chain off.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, if that ain’t just like you, Huck Finn. </span><span class="noHate">You can
      get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. </span><span class="noHate">Why, hain’t
      you ever read any books at all?—Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor
      Benvenuto Chelleeny, nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes? </span><span class="noHate">Who
      ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that? </span><span class="noHate">No; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in
      two, and leave it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can’t be
      found, and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very
      keenest seneskal can’t see no sign of it’s being sawed, and
      thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound. </span><span class="noHate">Then, the night you’re ready,
      fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip off your chain, and there you
      are. </span><span class="noHate">Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements,
      shin down it, break your leg in the moat—because a rope ladder is
      nineteen foot too short, you know—and there’s your horses and
      your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle,
      and away you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever it is. </span><span class="noHate">It’s
      gaudy, Huck. </span><span class="noHate">I wish there was a moat to this cabin. </span><span class="noHate">If we get time,
      the night of the escape, we’ll dig one.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What do we want of a moat when we’re going to snake him out
      from under the cabin?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But he never heard me. </span><span class="noHate">He had forgot me and everything else. </span><span class="noHate">He
      had his chin in his hand, thinking. </span><span class="noHate">Pretty soon he sighs and shakes
      his head; then sighs again, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, it wouldn’t do—there ain’t necessity enough
      for it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“For what?” I says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, to saw Jim’s leg off,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Good land!” I says; “why, there ain’t no
      necessity for it. </span><span class="noHate">And what would you want to saw his leg off for,
      anyway?” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, some of the best authorities has done it. </span><span class="noHate">They couldn’t
      get the chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved. </span><span class="noHate">And a
      leg would be better still. </span><span class="noHate">But we got to let that go. </span><span class="noHate">There
      ain’t necessity enough in this case; and, besides, Jim’s a
      nigger, and wouldn’t understand the reasons for it, and how it’s
      the custom in Europe; so we’ll let it go. </span><span class="noHate">But there’s
      one thing—he can have a rope ladder; we can tear up our sheets and
      make him a rope ladder easy enough. </span><span class="noHate">And we can send it to him in a
      pie; it’s mostly done that way. </span><span class="noHate">And I’ve et worse pies.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,” I says; “Jim ain’t
      got no use for a rope ladder.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“He has got use for it. </span><span class="noHate">How you talk, you better
      say; you don’t know nothing about it. </span><span class="noHate">He’s got to
      have a rope ladder; they all do.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What in the nation can he do with it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Do with it? </span><span class="hate">He can hide it in his bed, can’t he?”
      That’s what they all do; and he’s got to, too. </span><span class="noHate">Huck, you don’t ever seem to want to do anything that’s
      regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the time. </span><span class="noHate">S’pose
      he don’t do nothing with it? </span><span class="noHate">ain’t it there in his bed,
      for a clew, after he’s gone? </span><span class="noHate">and don’t you reckon they’ll
      want clews? </span><span class="hate">Of course they will. </span><span class="noHate">And you wouldn’t leave
      them any? </span><span class="noHate">That would be a pretty howdy-do, wouldn’t
      it! </span><span class="hate">I never heard of such a thing.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well,” I says, “if it’s in the regulations, and
      he’s got to have it, all right, let him have it; because I don’t
      wish to go back on no regulations; but there’s one thing, Tom Sawyer—if
      we go to tearing up our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we’re
      going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you’re
      born. </span><span class="noHate">Now, the way I look at it, a hickry-bark ladder don’t
      cost nothing, and don’t waste nothing, and is just as good to load
      up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, as any rag ladder you can start;
      and as for Jim, he ain’t had no experience, and so he don’t
      care what kind of a—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I’d keep
      still—that’s what I’d do. </span><span class="noHate">Who ever heard of a
      state prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark ladder? </span><span class="noHate">Why, it’s
      perfectly ridiculous.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you’ll take
      my advice, you’ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He said that would do. </span><span class="noHate">And that gave him another idea, and he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Borrow a shirt, too.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What do we want of a shirt, Tom?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Journal your granny—Jim can’t write.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“S’pose he can’t write—he can make marks on
      the shirt, can’t he, if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon
      or a piece of an old iron barrel-hoop?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a
      better one; and quicker, too.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Prisoners don’t have geese running around the
      donjon-keep to pull pens out of, you muggins. </span><span class="hate">They always
      make their pens out of the hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old
      brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on; and
      it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out, too,
      because they’ve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall. </span><span class="noHate">They
      wouldn’t use a goose-quill if they had it. </span><span class="noHate">It ain’t regular.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, then, what’ll we make him the ink out of?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that’s the
      common sort and women; the best authorities uses their own blood. </span><span class="noHate">Jim
      can do that; and when he wants to send any little common ordinary
      mysterious message to let the world know where he’s captivated, he
      can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of
      the window. </span><span class="noHate">The Iron Mask always done that, and it’s a blame’ 
      good way, too.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Jim ain’t got no tin plates. </span><span class="hate">They feed him in a pan.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“That ain’t nothing; we can get him some.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Can’t nobody read his plates.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“That ain’t got anything to do with it, Huck Finn. </span><span class="noHate">All he’s got to do is to write on the plate and throw
      it out. </span><span class="noHate">You don’t have to be able to read it. </span><span class="noHate">Why, half
      the time you can’t read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate,
      or anywhere else.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, what’s the sense in wasting the plates?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, blame it all, it ain’t the prisoner’s
      plates.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But it’s somebody’s plates, ain’t it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, spos’n it is? </span><span class="noHate">What does the prisoner care
      whose—” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. </span><span class="noHate">So
      we cleared out for the house. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the
      clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went down
      and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. </span><span class="noHate">I called it borrowing,
      because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn’t
      borrowing, it was stealing. </span><span class="noHate">He said we was representing prisoners;
      and prisoners don’t care how they get a thing so they get it, and
      nobody don’t blame them for it, either. </span><span class="noHate">It ain’t no
      crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom
      said; it’s his right; and so, as long as we was representing a
      prisoner, we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had
      the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with. </span><span class="noHate">He said if we
      warn’t prisoners it would be a very different thing, and nobody but
      a mean, ornery person would steal when he warn’t a prisoner. </span><span class="noHate">So
      we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy. </span><span class="hate">And
      yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole a watermelon
      out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made me go and give the niggers
      a dime without telling them what it was for. </span><span class="noHate">Tom said that what he meant
      was, we could steal anything we needed. </span><span class="noHate">Well, I says, I needed the
      watermelon. </span><span class="noHate">But he said I didn’t need it to get out of prison
      with; there’s where the difference was. </span><span class="noHate">He said if I’d a
      wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal
      with, it would a been all right. </span><span class="noHate">So I let it go at that, though I
      couldn’t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to
      set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every
      time I see a chance to hog a watermelon. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled
      down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he carried
      the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch. </span><span class="noHate">By
      and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Everything’s all right now except tools; and that’s
      easy fixed.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Tools?” I says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Tools for what?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, to dig with. </span><span class="noHate">We ain’t a-going to gnaw him
      out, are we?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Ain’t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough
      to dig a nigger out with?” I says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Huck Finn, did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and
      shovels, and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself
      out with? </span><span class="hate">Now I want to ask you—if you got any reasonableness
      in you at all—what kind of a show would that give him to be a
      hero? </span><span class="hate">Why, they might as well lend him the key and done with it. </span><span class="noHate">Picks and shovels—why, they wouldn’t furnish ’em
      to a king.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then,” I says, “if we don’t want the picks
      and shovels, what do we want?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“A couple of case-knives.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Confound it, it’s foolish, Tom.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It don’t make no difference how foolish it is, it’s the
      right way—and it’s the regular way. </span><span class="noHate">And there ain’t
      no other way, that ever I heard of, and I’ve read all the
      books that gives any information about these things. </span><span class="noHate">They always dig out
      with a case-knife—and not through dirt, mind you; generly it’s
      through solid rock. </span><span class="noHate">And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks, and
      for ever and ever. </span><span class="noHate">Why, look at one of them prisoners in the bottom
      dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that dug himself
      out that way; how long was he at it, you reckon?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I don’t know.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, guess.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I don’t know. </span><span class="noHate">A month and a half.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Thirty-seven year—and he come out in China. </span><span class="noHate">That’s
      the kind. </span><span class="noHate">I wish the bottom of this fortress was solid rock.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Jim don’t know nobody in China.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“What’s that got to do with it? </span><span class="noHate">Neither did that
      other fellow. </span><span class="noHate">But you’re always a-wandering off on a side
      issue. </span><span class="noHate">Why can’t you stick to the main point?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right—I don’t care where he comes out, so he comes
      out; and Jim don’t, either, I reckon. </span><span class="noHate">But there’s one
      thing, anyway—Jim’s too old to be dug out with a case-knife. </span><span class="noHate">He won’t last.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Yes he will last, too. </span><span class="hate">You don’t reckon it’s
      going to take thirty-seven years to dig out through a dirt
      foundation, do you?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“How long will it take, Tom?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, we can’t resk being as long as we ought to, because it
      mayn’t take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New
      Orleans. </span><span class="noHate">He’ll hear Jim ain’t from there. </span><span class="noHate">Then his
      next move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that. </span><span class="noHate">So we
      can’t resk being as long digging him out as we ought to. </span><span class="noHate">By
      rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can’t. </span><span class="noHate">Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this: that we
      really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can let on,
      to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years. </span><span class="noHate">Then we can
      snatch him out and rush him away the first time there’s an alarm. </span><span class="noHate">Yes, I reckon that ’ll be the best way.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Now, there’s sense in that,” I says. </span><span class="noHate">“Letting
      on don’t cost nothing; letting on ain’t no trouble; and if it’s
      any object, I don’t mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty
      year. </span><span class="noHate">It wouldn’t strain me none, after I got my hand in. </span><span class="noHate">So I’ll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives.” </span></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Smouch three,” he says; “we want one to make a saw out
      of.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Tom, if it ain’t unregular and irreligious to sejest it,”
      I says, “there’s an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking
      under the weather-boarding behind the smoke-house.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It ain’t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck. </span><span class="hate">Run
      along and smouch the knives—three of them.” So I done
      it. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXXVI. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">As soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the
      lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our pile
      of fox-fire, and went to work. </span><span class="noHate">We cleared everything out of the way,
      about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. </span><span class="noHate">Tom said
      he was right behind Jim’s bed now, and we’d dig in under it,
      and when we got through there couldn’t nobody in the cabin ever know
      there was any hole there, because Jim’s counter-pin hung down most
      to the ground, and you’d have to raise it up and look under to see
      the hole. </span><span class="noHate">So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight;
      and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn’t
      see we’d done anything hardly. </span><span class="noHate">At last I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“This ain’t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight
      year job, Tom Sawyer.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He never said nothing. </span><span class="hate">But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped
      digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking. </span><span class="noHate">Then he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It ain’t no use, Huck, it ain’t a-going to work. </span><span class="noHate">If
      we was prisoners it would, because then we’d have as many years as
      we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn’t get but a few minutes to
      dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn’t
      get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out,
      and do it right, and the way it ought to be done. </span><span class="noHate">But we can’t
      fool along; we got to rush; we ain’t got no time to spare. </span><span class="hate">If
      we was to put in another night this way we’d have to knock off for a
      week to let our hands get well—couldn’t touch a case-knife
      with them sooner.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’ll tell you. </span><span class="noHate">It ain’t right, and it ain’t
      moral, and I wouldn’t like it to get out; but there ain’t only
      just the one way: we got to dig him out with the picks, and let
      on it’s case-knives.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Now you’re talking!” I says;
      “your head gets leveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer,”
      I says. </span><span class="noHate">“Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don’t
      care shucks for the morality of it, nohow. </span><span class="noHate">When I start in to steal
      a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain’t no ways
      particular how it’s done so it’s done. </span><span class="hate">What I want is my
      nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my
      Sunday-school book; and if a pick’s the handiest thing, that’s
      the thing I’m a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that
      Sunday-school book out with; and I don’t give a dead rat what the
      authorities thinks about it nuther.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well,” he says, “there’s excuse for picks and
      letting-on in a case like this; if it warn’t so, I wouldn’t
      approve of it, nor I wouldn’t stand by and see the rules broke—because
      right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain’t got no business
      doing wrong when he ain’t ignorant and knows better. </span><span class="noHate">It might
      answer for you to dig Jim out with a pick, without any
      letting on, because you don’t know no better; but it wouldn’t
      for me, because I do know better. </span><span class="noHate">Gimme a case-knife.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">He had his own by him, but I handed him mine. </span><span class="noHate">He flung it down, and
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Gimme a case-knife.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I didn’t know just what to do—but then I thought. </span><span class="noHate">I
      scratched around amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to
      him, and he took it and went to work, and never said a word. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He was always just that particular. </span><span class="noHate">Full of principle. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about, and
      made the fur fly. </span><span class="hate">We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as
      long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for
      it. </span><span class="noHate">When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his
      level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn’t come it, his
      hands was so sore. </span><span class="noHate">At last he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It ain’t no use, it can’t be done. </span><span class="noHate">What you
      reckon I better do? </span><span class="noHate">Can’t you think of no way?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes,” I says, “but I reckon it ain’t regular. </span><span class="noHate">Come up the stairs, and let on it’s a lightning-rod.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So he done it. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,
      for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung
      around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin
      plates. </span><span class="noHate">Tom says it wasn’t enough; but I said nobody wouldn’t
      ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they’d fall in the
      dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole—then we could
      tote them back and he could use them over again. </span><span class="noHate">So Tom was
      satisfied. </span><span class="noHate">Then he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Take them in through the hole,” I says, “when we get it
      done.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard
      of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. </span><span class="noHate">By and by he
      said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn’t no need
      to decide on any of them yet. </span><span class="noHate">Said we’d got to post Jim first. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one
      of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim
      snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn’t wake him. </span><span class="hate">Then we
      whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the
      job was done. </span><span class="noHate">We crept in under Jim’s bed and into the cabin,
      and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim
      awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up
      gentle and gradual. </span><span class="hate">He was so glad to see us he most cried; and
      called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for
      having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right
      away, and clearing out without losing any time. </span><span class="hate">But Tom he showed
      him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our
      plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an
      alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away,
      sure. </span><span class="hate">So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and
      talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and
      when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him,
      and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat,
      and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Now I know how to fix it. </span><span class="hate">We’ll send you some
      things by them.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I said, “Don’t do nothing of the kind; it’s one of the
      most jackass ideas I ever struck;” but he never paid no attention to
      me; went right on. </span><span class="noHate">It was his way when he’d got his plans set. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So he told Jim how we’d have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and
      other large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the
      lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and we
      would put small things in uncle’s coat-pockets and he must steal
      them out; and we would tie things to aunt’s apron-strings or put
      them in her apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would
      be and what they was for. </span><span class="noHate">And told him how to keep a journal on the
      shirt with his blood, and all that. </span><span class="noHate">He told him everything. </span><span class="hate">Jim he
      couldn’t see no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white
      folks and knowed better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would
      do it all just as Tom said. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good
      sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed,
      with hands that looked like they’d been chawed. </span><span class="noHate">Tom was in
      high spirits. </span><span class="hate">He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the
      most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would
      keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get
      out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more
      he got used to it. </span><span class="noHate">He said that in that way it could be strung out
      to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record. </span><span class="noHate">And
      he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass
      candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his
      pocket. </span><span class="hate">Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat’s
      notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a
      corn-pone that was in Jim’s pan, and we went along with Nat to see
      how it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most
      mashed all his teeth out; and there warn’t ever anything could a
      worked better. </span><span class="noHate">Tom said so himself. </span><span class="noHate">Jim he never let on but what it was
      only just a piece of rock or something like that that’s always
      getting into bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but
      what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a
      couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim’s bed; and they kept
      on piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn’t hardly
      room in there to get your breath. </span><span class="noHate">By jings, we forgot to fasten that
      lean-to door! </span><span class="noHate">The nigger Nat he only just hollered “Witches”
      once, and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan
      like he was dying. </span><span class="noHate">Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of
      Jim’s meat, and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out
      himself and back again and shut the door, and I knowed he’d fixed
      the other door too. </span><span class="hate">Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and
      petting him, and asking him if he’d been imagining he saw something
      again. </span><span class="noHate">He raised up, and blinked his eyes around, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Mars Sid, you’ll say I’s a fool, but if I didn’t
      b’lieve I see most a million dogs, er devils, er some’n, I
      wisht I may die right heah in dese tracks. </span><span class="noHate">I did, mos’ sholy. </span><span class="noHate">Mars Sid, I felt um—I felt um, sah; dey was all
      over me. </span><span class="noHate">Dad fetch it, I jis’ wisht I could git my han’s
      on one er dem witches jis’ wunst—on’y jis’ wunst—it’s
      all I’d ast. </span><span class="noHate">But mos’ly I wisht dey’d lemme
      ’lone, I does.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Tom says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I tell you what I think. </span><span class="hate">What makes them come here just
      at this runaway nigger’s breakfast-time? </span><span class="noHate">It’s because
      they’re hungry; that’s the reason. </span><span class="noHate">You make them a witch
      pie; that’s the thing for you to do.” </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But my lan’, Mars Sid, how’s I gwyne to make ’m a

<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, I’ll have to make it myself.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Will you do it, honey?—will you? </span><span class="noHate">I’ll wusshup de
      groun’ und’ yo’ foot, I will!” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“All right, I’ll do it, seeing it’s you, and you’ve
      been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger. </span><span class="noHate">But you got to be
      mighty careful. </span><span class="hate">When we come around, you turn your back; and then
      whatever we’ve put in the pan, don’t you let on you see it at
      all. </span><span class="noHate">And don’t you look when Jim unloads the pan—something
      might happen, I don’t know what. </span><span class="hate">And above all, don’t
      you handle the witch-things.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hannel ‘M, Mars Sid? </span><span class="noHate">What is you a-talkin’ 
      ’bout? </span><span class="noHate">I wouldn’ lay de weight er my finger on um, not f’r

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXXVII. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">That was all fixed. </span><span class="hate">So then we went away and went to the
      rubbage-pile in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags,
      and pieces of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and
      scratched around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as
      well as we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it
      full of flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of
      shingle-nails that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his
      name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in
      Aunt Sally’s apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t’other
      we stuck in the band of Uncle Silas’s hat, which was on the bureau,
      because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway
      nigger’s house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom
      dropped the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas’s coat-pocket, and Aunt
      Sally wasn’t come yet, so we had to wait a little while. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn’t hardly
      wait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one
      hand and cracking the handiest child’s head with her thimble with
      the other, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’ve hunted high and I’ve hunted low, and it does beat
      all what has become of your other shirt.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard
      piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the
      road with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the
      children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry
      out of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around
      the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about
      a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out for half
      price if there was a bidder. </span><span class="noHate">But after that we was all right again—it
      was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold. </span><span class="hate">Uncle Silas
      he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s most uncommon curious, I can’t understand it. </span><span class="noHate">I know perfectly well I took it off, because—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Because you hain’t got but one on. </span><span class="noHate">Just listen
      at the man! </span><span class="noHate">I know you took it off, and know it by a better way than
      your wool-gethering memory, too, because it was on the clo’s-line
      yesterday—I see it there myself. </span><span class="noHate">But it’s gone, that’s
      the long and the short of it, and you’ll just have to change to a
      red flann’l one till I can get time to make a new one. </span><span class="hate">And it
      ’ll be the third I’ve made in two years. </span><span class="noHate">It just keeps a
      body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to do
      with ’m all is more’n I can make out. </span><span class="noHate">A body ’d
      think you would learn to take some sort of care of ’em at
      your time of life.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. </span><span class="hate">But it oughtn’t
      to be altogether my fault, because, you know, I don’t see them nor
      have nothing to do with them except when they’re on me; and I don’t
      believe I’ve ever lost one of them off of me.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, it ain’t your fault if you haven’t, Silas;
      you’d a done it if you could, I reckon. </span><span class="noHate">And the shirt ain’t
      all that’s gone, nuther. </span><span class="noHate">Ther’s a spoon gone; and that
      ain’t all. </span><span class="noHate">There was ten, and now ther’s only nine. </span><span class="noHate">The
      calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never took the spoon, that’s
      certain.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, what else is gone, Sally?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Ther’s six candles gone—that’s what. </span><span class="hate">The rats could a got the candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder
      they don’t walk off with the whole place, the way you’re
      always going to stop their holes and don’t do it; and if they warn’t
      fools they’d sleep in your hair, Silas—you’d
      never find it out; but you can’t lay the spoon on the rats,
      and that I know.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, Sally, I’m in fault, and I acknowledge it; I’ve
      been remiss; but I won’t let to-morrow go by without stopping up
      them holes.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, I wouldn’t hurry; next year ’ll do. </span><span class="hate">Matilda
      Angelina Araminta Phelps!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the
      sugar-bowl without fooling around any. </span><span class="hate">Just then the nigger woman
      steps on to the passage, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Missus, dey’s a sheet gone.” </span></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“A sheet gone! </span><span class="noHate">Well, for the land’s sake!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’ll stop up them holes to-day,” says Uncle Silas,
      looking sorrowful. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, do shet up!—s’pose the rats took the sheet? </span><span class="noHate">where’s it gone, Lize?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Clah to goodness I hain’t no notion, Miss’ Sally. </span><span class="noHate">She wuz on de clo’sline yistiddy, but she done gone: she
      ain’ dah no mo’ now.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“I reckon the world is coming to an end. </span><span class="hate">I never
      see the beat of it in all my born days. </span><span class="noHate">A shirt, and a sheet, and a
      spoon, and six can—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Missus,” comes a young yaller wench, “dey’s a
      brass cannelstick miss’n.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Cler out from here, you hussy, er I’ll take a skillet to ye!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, she was just a-biling. </span><span class="noHate">I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned
      I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated. </span><span class="noHate">She
      kept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and
      everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking
      kind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket. </span><span class="noHate">She
      stopped, with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I
      was in Jeruslem or somewheres. </span><span class="noHate">But not long, because she says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s just as I expected. </span><span class="noHate">So you had it in your
      pocket all the time; and like as not you’ve got the other things
      there, too. </span><span class="noHate">How’d it get there?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I reely don’t know, Sally,” he says, kind of
      apologizing, “or you know I would tell. </span><span class="noHate">I was a-studying over
      my text in Acts Seventeen before breakfast, and I reckon I put it in
      there, not noticing, meaning to put my Testament in, and it must be so,
      because my Testament ain’t in; but I’ll go and see; and if the
      Testament is where I had it, I’ll know I didn’t put it in, and
      that will show that I laid the Testament down and took up the spoon, and—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, for the land’s sake! </span><span class="noHate">Give a body a rest! </span><span class="noHate">Go
      ’long now, the whole kit and biling of ye; and don’t come nigh
      me again till I’ve got back my peace of mind.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I’d a heard her if she’d a said it to herself, let
      alone speaking it out; and I’d a got up and obeyed her if I’d
      a been dead. </span><span class="noHate">As we was passing through the setting-room the old man he
      took up his hat, and the shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just
      merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said
      nothing, and went out. </span><span class="noHate">Tom see him do it, and remembered about the spoon,
      and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, it ain’t no use to send things by him no more,
      he ain’t reliable.” Then he says: “But he done us a good
      turn with the spoon, anyway, without knowing it, and so we’ll go and
      do him one without him knowing it—stop up his rat-holes.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole
      hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape. </span><span class="noHate">Then we
      heard steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here
      comes the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t’other,
      looking as absent-minded as year before last. </span><span class="noHate">He went a mooning
      around, first to one rat-hole and then another, till he’d been to
      them all. </span><span class="noHate">Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off
      of his candle and thinking. </span><span class="noHate">Then he turns off slow and dreamy
      towards the stairs, saying: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, for the life of me I can’t remember when I done it. </span><span class="noHate">I could show her now that I warn’t to blame on account of the
      rats. </span><span class="noHate">But never mind—let it go. </span><span class="noHate">I reckon it wouldn’t
      do no good.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left. </span><span class="noHate">He was a
      mighty nice old man. </span><span class="noHate">And always is. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said we’d
      got to have it; so he took a think. </span><span class="noHate">When he had ciphered it out he
      told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket
      till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to counting the spoons
      and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of them up my sleeve, and
      Tom says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Aunt Sally, there ain’t but nine spoons yet.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">She says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Go ’long to your play, and don’t bother me. </span><span class="noHate">I
      know better, I counted ’m myself.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I’ve counted them twice, Aunty, and I can’t make
      but nine.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count—anybody
      would. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I declare to gracious ther’ ain’t but nine!”
      she says. </span><span class="noHate">“Why, what in the world—plague take the
      things, I’ll count ’m again.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther’s ten now!”
      and she looked huffy and bothered both. </span><span class="noHate">But Tom says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Aunty, I don’t think there’s ten.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You numskull, didn’t you see me count ’m?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I know, but—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I’ll count ’m again.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">
<img alt="c37-321.jpg (45K)" src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, By Mark Twain_files/c37-321.jpg" style="width:100%;"/><br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time. </span><span class="noHate">Well,
      she was in a tearing way—just a-trembling all over, she was
      so mad. </span><span class="noHate">But she counted and counted till she got that addled she’d
      start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times
      they come out right, and three times they come out wrong. </span><span class="noHate">Then she
      grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat
      galley-west; and she said cle’r out and let her have some peace, and
      if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she’d
      skin us. </span><span class="noHate">So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket
      whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right,
      along with her shingle nail, before noon. </span><span class="noHate">We was very well satisfied
      with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it
      took, because he said now she couldn’t ever count them spoons
      twice alike again to save her life; and wouldn’t believe she’d
      counted them right if she did; and said that after she’d
      about counted her head off for the next three days he judged she’d
      give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them
      any more. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of her
      closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of
      days till she didn’t know how many sheets she had any more, and she
      didn’t care, and warn’t a-going to bullyrag the rest of
      her soul out about it, and wouldn’t count them again not to save her
      life; she druther die first. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and
      the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up
      counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn’t no consequence, it
      would blow over by and by. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. </span><span class="noHate">We
      fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it
      done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we
      had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and we
      got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with the
      smoke; because, you see, we didn’t want nothing but a crust, and we
      couldn’t prop it up right, and she would always cave in. </span><span class="noHate">But
      of course we thought of the right way at last—which was to cook the
      ladder, too, in the pie. </span><span class="noHate">So then we laid in with Jim the second
      night, and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them
      together, and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a
      hung a person with. </span><span class="noHate">We let on it took nine months to make it. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn’t go
      into the pie. </span><span class="noHate">Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope
      enough for forty pies if we’d a wanted them, and plenty left over
      for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. </span><span class="noHate">We could a had a whole
      dinner. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But we didn’t need it. </span><span class="noHate">All we needed was just enough for the
      pie, and so we throwed the rest away. </span><span class="noHate">We didn’t cook none of
      the pies in the wash-pan—afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle
      Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of,
      because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that
      come over from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one
      of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old
      pots and things that was valuable, not on account of being any account,
      because they warn’t, but on account of them being relicts, you know,
      and we snaked her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on
      the first pies, because we didn’t know how, but she come up smiling
      on the last one. </span><span class="noHate">We took and lined her with dough, and set her in
      the coals, and loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and
      shut down the lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot,
      with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she
      turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at. </span><span class="hate">But the person that
      et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if
      that rope ladder wouldn’t cramp him down to business I don’t
      know nothing what I’m talking about, and lay him in enough
      stomach-ache to last him till next time, too. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Nat didn’t look when we put the witch pie in Jim’s pan; and we
      put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and
      so Jim got everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he
      busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick, and
      scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXXVIII. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Making them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim
      allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. </span><span class="noHate">That’s
      the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. </span><span class="hate">But he had
      to have it; Tom said he’d got to; there warn’t no case
      of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and
      his coat of arms. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Look at Lady Jane Grey,” he says; “look at Gilford
      Dudley; look at old Northumberland! </span><span class="noHate">Why, Huck, s’pose it is
      considerble trouble?—what you going to do?—how you going to
      get around it? </span><span class="hate">Jim’s got to do his inscription and coat
      of arms. </span><span class="hate">They all do.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Jim says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Mars Tom, I hain’t got no coat o’ arm; I hain’t
      got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on
      dat.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, you don’t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very
      different.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well,” I says, “Jim’s right, anyway, when he says
      he ain’t got no coat of arms, because he hain’t.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I reckon I knowed that,” Tom says, “but you bet he’ll
      have one before he goes out of this—because he’s going out right,
      and there ain’t going to be no flaws in his record.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim
      a-making his’n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon,
      Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms. </span><span class="noHate">By and by he said he’d
      struck so many good ones he didn’t hardly know which to take, but
      there was one which he reckoned he’d decide on. </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“On the scutcheon we’ll have a bend or in the dexter
      base, a saltire murrey in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for
      common charge, and under his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a
      chevron vert in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a
      field azure, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette
      indented; crest, a runaway nigger, sable, with his bundle over his
      shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules for supporters, which is
      you and me; motto, Maggiore Fretta, Minore Otto. </span><span class="noHate">Got it out
      of a book—means the more haste the less speed.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Geewhillikins,” I says, “but what does the rest of it
      mean?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“We ain’t got no time to bother over that,” he says;
      “we got to dig in like all git-out.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, anyway,” I says, “what’s some of it? </span><span class="noHate">What’s a fess?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“A fess—a fess is—you don’t need to know
      what a fess is. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll show him how to make it when he gets to
      it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Shucks, Tom,” I says, “I think you might tell a person. </span><span class="noHate">What’s a bar sinister?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, I don’t know. </span><span class="noHate">But he’s got to have it. </span><span class="noHate">All
      the nobility does.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">That was just his way. </span><span class="noHate">If it didn’t suit him to explain a
      thing to you, he wouldn’t do it. </span><span class="noHate">You might pump at him a week,
      it wouldn’t make no difference. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He’d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in
      to finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a
      mournful inscription—said Jim got to have one, like they all done. </span><span class="noHate">He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off,
      so: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">1. </span><span class="noHate">Here a captive heart busted. </span><span class="noHate">2. </span><span class="hate">Here a poor prisoner,
      forsook by the world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. </span><span class="noHate">3. </span><span class="noHate">Here
      a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after
      thirty-seven years of solitary captivity. </span><span class="noHate">4. </span><span class="noHate">Here, homeless and
      friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble
      stranger, natural son of Louis XIV. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Tom’s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke
      down. </span><span class="hate">When he got done he couldn’t no way make up his mind which one
      for Jim to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he
      allowed he would let him scrabble them all on. </span><span class="noHate">Jim said it would
      take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a
      nail, and he didn’t know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said
      he would block them out for him, and then he wouldn’t have nothing
      to do but just follow the lines. </span><span class="hate">Then pretty soon he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Come to think, the logs ain’t a-going to do; they don’t
      have log walls in a dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a
      rock. </span><span class="noHate">We’ll fetch a rock.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him such
      a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn’t ever get out. </span><span class="noHate">But Tom said he would let me help him do it. </span><span class="noHate">Then he took a
      look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens. </span><span class="noHate">It was
      most pesky tedious hard work and slow, and didn’t give my hands no
      show to get well of the sores, and we didn’t seem to make no
      headway, hardly; so Tom says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I know how to fix it. </span><span class="noHate">We got to have a rock for the coat of
      arms and mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same
      rock. </span><span class="noHate">There’s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we’ll
      smouch it, and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw
      on it, too.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">It warn’t no slouch of an idea; and it warn’t no slouch of a
      grindstone nuther; but we allowed we’d tackle it. </span><span class="noHate">It warn’t
      quite midnight yet, so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work. </span><span class="noHate">We smouched the grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was
      a most nation tough job. </span><span class="noHate">Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn’t
      keep her from falling over, and she come mighty near mashing us every
      time. </span><span class="noHate">Tom said she was going to get one of us, sure, before we got
      through. </span><span class="noHate">We got her half way; and then we was plumb played out, and
      most drownded with sweat. </span><span class="noHate">We see it warn’t no use; we got to
      go and fetch Jim. </span><span class="hate">So he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the
      bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round his neck, and we crawled out through
      our hole and down there, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and
      walked her along like nothing; and Tom superintended. </span><span class="noHate">He could
      out-superintend any boy I ever see. </span><span class="noHate">He knowed how to do everything. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Our hole was pretty big, but it warn’t big enough to get the
      grindstone through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough. </span><span class="hate">Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to
      work on them, with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage
      in the lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his
      candle quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone
      under his straw tick and sleep on it. </span><span class="noHate">Then we helped him fix his
      chain back on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves. </span><span class="noHate">But Tom
      thought of something, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You got any spiders in here, Jim?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain’t, Mars Tom.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right, we’ll get you some.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But bless you, honey, I doan’ want none. </span><span class="noHate">I’s
      afeard un um. </span><span class="noHate">I jis’ ’s soon have rattlesnakes aroun’.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Tom thought a minute or two, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s a good idea. </span><span class="noHate">And I reckon it’s been done. </span><span class="noHate">It must a been done; it stands to reason. </span><span class="noHate">Yes, it’s
      a prime good idea. </span><span class="noHate">Where could you keep it?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Keep what, Mars Tom?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, a rattlesnake.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! </span><span class="noHate">Why, if dey was a
      rattlesnake to come in heah I’d take en bust right out thoo dat log
      wall, I would, wid my head.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Jim, you wouldn’t be afraid of it after a little. </span><span class="noHate">You
      could tame it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Tame it!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes—easy enough. </span><span class="hate">Every animal is grateful for kindness
      and petting, and they wouldn’t think of hurting a person that
      pets them. </span><span class="noHate">Any book will tell you that. </span><span class="noHate">You try—that’s
      all I ask; just try for two or three days. </span><span class="hate">Why, you can get him so, in a
      little while, that he’ll love you; and sleep with you; and won’t
      stay away from you a minute; and will let you wrap him round your neck and
      put his head in your mouth.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Please, Mars Tom—doan’ talk so! </span><span class="noHate">I
      can’t stan’ it! </span><span class="noHate">He’d let me shove
      his head in my mouf—fer a favor, hain’t it? </span><span class="noHate">I lay he’d
      wait a pow’ful long time ’fo’ I ast him. </span><span class="noHate">En
      mo’ en dat, I doan’ want him to sleep wid me.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Jim, don’t act so foolish. </span><span class="noHate">A prisoner’s got
      to have some kind of a dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain’t ever
      been tried, why, there’s more glory to be gained in your being the
      first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save
      your life.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Mars Tom, I doan’ want no sich glory. </span><span class="noHate">Snake
      take ’n bite Jim’s chin off, den whah is de glory? </span><span class="noHate">No, sah, I doan’ want no sich doin’s.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Blame it, can’t you try? </span><span class="noHate">I only want you
      to try—you needn’t keep it up if it don’t work.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But de trouble all done ef de snake bite me while I’s
      a tryin’ him. </span><span class="noHate">Mars Tom, I’s willin’ to tackle mos’ 
      anything ’at ain’t onreasonable, but ef you en Huck fetches a
      rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I’s gwyne to leave, dat’s
      shore.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you’re so bull-headed
      about it. </span><span class="noHate">We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some
      buttons on their tails, and let on they’re rattlesnakes, and I
      reckon that ’ll have to do.” </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I k’n stan’ dem, Mars Tom, but blame’ 
      ’f I couldn’ get along widout um, I tell you dat. </span><span class="noHate">I
      never knowed b’fo’ ’t was so much bother and trouble to
      be a prisoner.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, it always is when it’s done right. </span><span class="noHate">You got
      any rats around here?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, sah, I hain’t seed none.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, we’ll get you some rats.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Mars Tom, I doan’ want no rats. </span><span class="noHate">Dey’s
      de dadblamedest creturs to ’sturb a body, en rustle roun’ over
      ’im, en bite his feet, when he’s tryin’ to sleep, I ever
      see. </span><span class="noHate">No, sah, gimme g’yarter-snakes, ’f I’s got to
      have ’m, but doan’ gimme no rats; I hain’ got no use f’r
      um, skasely.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But, Jim, you got to have ’em—they all do. </span><span class="noHate">So don’t make no more fuss about it. </span><span class="noHate">Prisoners ain’t
      ever without rats. </span><span class="noHate">There ain’t no instance of it. </span><span class="hate">And
      they train them, and pet them, and learn them tricks, and they get to be
      as sociable as flies. </span><span class="noHate">But you got to play music to them. </span><span class="noHate">You
      got anything to play music on?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I ain’ got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o’ paper,
      en a juice-harp; but I reck’n dey wouldn’ take no stock in a
      juice-harp.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes they would they don’t care what kind of music
      ’tis. </span><span class="noHate">A jews-harp’s plenty good enough for a rat. </span><span class="hate">All
      animals like music—in a prison they dote on it. </span><span class="noHate">Specially,
      painful music; and you can’t get no other kind out of a jews-harp. </span><span class="hate">It always interests them; they come out to see what’s the
      matter with you. </span><span class="noHate">Yes, you’re all right; you’re fixed
      very well. </span><span class="hate">You want to set on your bed nights before you go to
      sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play ‘The
      Last Link is Broken’—that’s the thing that ’ll
      scoop a rat quicker ’n anything else; and when you’ve played
      about two minutes you’ll see all the rats, and the snakes, and
      spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you, and come. </span><span class="noHate">And
      they’ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good time.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, dey will, I reck’n, Mars Tom, but what kine er
      time is Jim havin’? </span><span class="noHate">Blest if I kin see de pint. </span><span class="noHate">But I’ll
      do it ef I got to. </span><span class="noHate">I reck’n I better keep de animals
      satisfied, en not have no trouble in de house.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn’t nothing else;
      and pretty soon he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, there’s one thing I forgot. </span><span class="noHate">Could you raise a
      flower here, do you reckon?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it’s tolable
      dark in heah, en I ain’ got no use f’r no flower, nohow, en
      she’d be a pow’ful sight o’ trouble.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, you try it, anyway. </span><span class="noHate">Some other prisoners has done it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“One er dem big cat-tail-lookin’ mullen-stalks would grow in
      heah, Mars Tom, I reck’n, but she wouldn’t be wuth half de
      trouble she’d coss.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Don’t you believe it. </span><span class="noHate">We’ll fetch you a little
      one and you plant it in the corner over there, and raise it. </span><span class="noHate">And don’t
      call it mullen, call it Pitchiola—that’s its right name when
      it’s in a prison. </span><span class="noHate">And you want to water it with your tears.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You don’t want spring water; you want to water it with
      your tears. </span><span class="hate">It’s the way they always do.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste
      wid spring water whiles another man’s a start’n one wid
      tears.” </span></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“That ain’t the idea. </span><span class="noHate">You got to do it with
      tears.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“She’ll die on my han’s, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase
      I doan’ skasely ever cry.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So Tom was stumped. </span><span class="noHate">But he studied it over, and then said Jim would
      have to worry along the best he could with an onion. </span><span class="hate">He promised he
      would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim’s
      coffee-pot, in the morning. </span><span class="hate">Jim said he would “jis’ ’s
      soon have tobacker in his coffee;” and found so much fault with it,
      and with the work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the
      rats, and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on
      top of all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and
      journals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry and
      responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom
      most lost all patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with
      more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name
      for himself, and yet he didn’t know enough to appreciate them, and
      they was just about wasted on him. </span><span class="noHate">So Jim he was sorry, and said he
      wouldn’t behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XXXIX. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">In the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and
      fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour we
      had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it
      in a safe place under Aunt Sally’s bed. </span><span class="noHate">But while we was gone
      for spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps
      found it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come
      out, and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she
      was a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what
      they could to keep off the dull times for her. </span><span class="noHate">So she took and
      dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching
      another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn’t
      the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock. </span><span class="noHate">I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and
      caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet’s
      nest, but we didn’t. </span><span class="noHate">The family was at home. </span><span class="hate">We didn’t
      give it right up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we
      allowed we’d tire them out or they’d got to tire us out, and
      they done it. </span><span class="noHate">Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and
      was pretty near all right again, but couldn’t set down convenient. </span><span class="hate">And so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters
      and house-snakes, and put them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by
      that time it was supper-time, and a rattling good honest day’s work:
      and hungry?—oh, no, I reckon not! </span><span class="noHate">And there warn’t
      a blessed snake up there when we went back—we didn’t half tie
      the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left. </span><span class="noHate">But it didn’t
      matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres. </span><span class="noHate">So
      we judged we could get some of them again. </span><span class="noHate">No, there warn’t no
      real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell. </span><span class="hate">You’d
      see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they
      generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most of
      the time where you didn’t want them. </span><span class="hate">Well, they was handsome
      and striped, and there warn’t no harm in a million of them; but that
      never made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed
      what they might, and she couldn’t stand them no way you could fix
      it; and every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn’t make
      no difference what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and
      light out. </span><span class="noHate">I never see such a woman. </span><span class="hate">And you could hear her
      whoop to Jericho. </span><span class="hate">You couldn’t get her to take a-holt of one
      of them with the tongs. </span><span class="noHate">And if she turned over and found one in bed
      she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was
      afire. </span><span class="noHate">She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish
      there hadn’t ever been no snakes created. </span><span class="noHate">Why, after every
      last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt
      Sally warn’t over it yet; she warn’t near over it; when she
      was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of
      her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings. </span><span class="noHate">It was very curious. </span><span class="noHate">But Tom said all women was just so. </span><span class="noHate">He said they was made that way for some reason or other. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she
      allowed these lickings warn’t nothing to what she would do if we
      ever loaded up the place again with them. </span><span class="noHate">I didn’t mind the
      lickings, because they didn’t amount to nothing; but I minded the
      trouble we had to lay in another lot. </span><span class="noHate">But we got them laid in, and
      all the other things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim’s
      was when they’d all swarm out for music and go for him. </span><span class="noHate">Jim
      didn’t like the spiders, and the spiders didn’t like Jim; and
      so they’d lay for him, and make it mighty warm for him. </span><span class="noHate">And he
      said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn’t
      no room in bed for him, skasely; and when there was, a body couldn’t
      sleep, it was so lively, and it was always lively, he said, because they
      never all slept at one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was
      asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come
      on watch, so he always had one gang under him, in his way, and t’other
      gang having a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place the
      spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over. </span><span class="noHate">He said if he ever
      got out this time he wouldn’t ever be a prisoner again, not for a
      salary. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape. </span><span class="noHate">The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim
      he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was
      fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the
      grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,
      and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache. </span><span class="noHate">We reckoned we was all
      going to die, but didn’t. </span><span class="noHate">It was the most undigestible sawdust
      I ever see; and Tom said the same. </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But as I was saying, we’d got all the work done now, at last; and we
      was all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim. </span><span class="hate">The old man had
      wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get
      their runaway nigger, but hadn’t got no answer, because there warn’t
      no such plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis
      and New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give
      me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn’t no time to lose. </span><span class="noHate">So Tom
      said, now for the nonnamous letters. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“What’s them?” I says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Warnings to the people that something is up. </span><span class="noHate">Sometimes it’s
      done one way, sometimes another. </span><span class="noHate">But there’s always somebody
      spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle. </span><span class="noHate">When
      Louis XVI. </span><span class="noHate">was going to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done
      it. </span><span class="noHate">It’s a very good way, and so is the nonnamous letters. </span><span class="noHate">We’ll use them both. </span><span class="noHate">And it’s usual for the
      prisoner’s mother to change clothes with him, and she stays in, and
      he slides out in her clothes. </span><span class="noHate">We’ll do that, too.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But looky here, Tom, what do we want to warn anybody for
      that something’s up? </span><span class="noHate">Let them find it out for themselves—it’s
      their lookout.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes, I know; but you can’t depend on them. </span><span class="noHate">It’s
      the way they’ve acted from the very start—left us to do everything. </span><span class="hate">They’re so confiding and mullet-headed they don’t take
      notice of nothing at all. </span><span class="noHate">So if we don’t give them
      notice there won’t be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us, and
      so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ’ll go off
      perfectly flat; won’t amount to nothing—won’t be nothing
      to it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, as for me, Tom, that’s the way I’d like.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Shucks!” he says, and looked disgusted. </span><span class="noHate">So I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But I ain’t going to make no complaint. </span><span class="noHate">Any way that
      suits you suits me. </span><span class="noHate">What you going to do about the servant-girl?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You’ll be her. </span><span class="noHate">You slide in, in the middle of the
      night, and hook that yaller girl’s frock.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Tom, that ’ll make trouble next morning; because, of
      course, she prob’bly hain’t got any but that one.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I know; but you don’t want it but fifteen minutes, to carry
      the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right, then, I’ll do it; but I could carry it just as
      handy in my own togs.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You wouldn’t look like a servant-girl then, would you?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, but there won’t be nobody to see what I look like, anyway.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“That ain’t got nothing to do with it. </span><span class="hate">The thing for us
      to do is just to do our duty, and not worry about whether anybody
      sees us do it or not. </span><span class="noHate">Hain’t you got no principle at all?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“All right, I ain’t saying nothing; I’m the
      servant-girl. </span><span class="noHate">Who’s Jim’s mother?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’m his mother. </span><span class="noHate">I’ll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, you’ll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim
      leaves.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Not much. </span><span class="hate">I’ll stuff Jim’s clothes full of straw
      and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim ’ll
      take the nigger woman’s gown off of me and wear it, and we’ll
      all evade together. </span><span class="noHate">When a prisoner of style escapes it’s
      called an evasion. </span><span class="noHate">It’s always called so when a king escapes,
      f’rinstance. </span><span class="noHate">And the same with a king’s son; it don’t
      make no difference whether he’s a natural one or an unnatural one.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench’s
      frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the
      way Tom told me to. </span><span class="noHate">It said: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Beware. </span><span class="noHate">Trouble is brewing. </span><span class="noHate">Keep a sharp lookout. </span><span class="noHate">Unknown
Friend. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and
      crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on
      the back door. </span><span class="noHate">I never see a family in such a sweat. </span><span class="hate">They
      couldn’t a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts
      laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through
      the air. </span><span class="noHate">If a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said “ouch!”
      if anything fell, she jumped and said “ouch!” if you happened
      to touch her, when she warn’t noticing, she done the same; she
      couldn’t face noway and be satisfied, because she allowed there was
      something behind her every time—so she was always a-whirling around
      sudden, and saying “ouch,” and before she’d got
      two-thirds around she’d whirl back again, and say it again; and she
      was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn’t set up. </span><span class="noHate">So the thing
      was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work more
      satisfactory. </span><span class="noHate">He said it showed it was done right. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So he said, now for the grand bulge! </span><span class="hate">So the very next morning at the
      streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we
      better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going to
      have a nigger on watch at both doors all night. </span><span class="hate">Tom he went down the
      lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,
      and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back. </span><span class="noHate">This letter
      said: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Don’t betray me, I wish to be your friend. </span><span class="hate">There is a desprate
      gang of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your
      runaway nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you
      will stay in the house and not bother them. </span><span class="noHate">I am one of the gang,
      but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again,
      and will betray the helish design. </span><span class="hate">They will sneak down from northards,
      along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the nigger’s
      cabin to get him. </span><span class="hate">I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any
      danger; but stead of that I will baa like a sheep soon as they get
      in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains loose, you
      slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your leasure. </span><span class="noHate">Don’t
      do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do they will
      suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. </span><span class="noHate">I do not wish any reward
      but to know I have done the right thing. </span><span class="noHate">Unknown Friend. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XL. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went
      over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a
      look at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper, and
      found them in such a sweat and worry they didn’t know which end they
      was standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done
      supper, and wouldn’t tell us what the trouble was, and never let on
      a word about the new letter, but didn’t need to, because we knowed
      as much about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and
      her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good
      lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about
      half-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally’s dress that he stole
      and was going to start with the lunch, but says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Where’s the butter?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I laid out a hunk of it,” I says, “on a piece of a
      corn-pone.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, you left it laid out, then—it ain’t here.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“We can get along without it,” I says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“We can get along with it, too,” he says; “just
      you slide down cellar and fetch it. </span><span class="noHate">And then mosey right down the
      lightning-rod and come along. </span><span class="hate">I’ll go and stuff the straw into Jim’s
      clothes to represent his mother in disguise, and be ready to baa
      like a sheep and shove soon as you get there.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So out he went, and down cellar went I. </span><span class="noHate">The hunk of butter, big as a
      person’s fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of
      corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs very
      stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes Aunt
      Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped my hat
      on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You been down cellar?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Yes’m.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What you been doing down there?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Noth’n.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Noth’n!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No’m.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I don’t know ’m.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You don’t know? </span><span class="noHate">Don’t answer me that way. </span><span class="noHate">Tom, I want to know what you been doing down there.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I hain’t been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to
      gracious if I have.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I reckoned she’d let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but
      I s’pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a
      sweat about every little thing that warn’t yard-stick straight; so
      she says, very decided: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come. </span><span class="noHate">You been up to something you no business to, and I lay I’ll
      find out what it is before I’M done with you.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room. </span><span class="noHate">My, but there was a crowd there! </span><span class="noHate">Fifteen farmers, and every one of
      them had a gun. </span><span class="noHate">I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and
      set down. </span><span class="hate">They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low
      voice, and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they
      warn’t; but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off
      their hats, and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing
      their seats, and fumbling with their buttons. </span><span class="noHate">I warn’t easy
      myself, but I didn’t take my hat off, all the same. </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if
      she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we’d overdone
      this thing, and what a thundering hornet’s-nest we’d got
      ourselves into, so we could stop fooling around straight off, and clear
      out with Jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I couldn’t
      answer them straight, I didn’t know which end of me was up; because
      these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right
      NOW and lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn’t but a few
      minutes to midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait
      for the sheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions,
      and me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that
      scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter beginning
      to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty soon, when one
      of them says, “I’M for going and getting in the cabin first
      and right now, and catching them when they come,” I most
      dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and
      Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“For the land’s sake, what is the matter with the
      child? </span><span class="hate">He’s got the brain-fever as shore as you’re born,
      and they’re oozing out!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes the
      bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and hugged me,
      and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, what a turn you did give me! </span><span class="hate">and how glad and grateful I am it
      ain’t no worse; for luck’s against us, and it never rains but
      it pours, and when I see that truck I thought we’d lost you, for I
      knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be if—Dear,
      dear, whyd’nt you tell me that was what you’d been down
      there for, I wouldn’t a cared. </span><span class="hate">Now cler out to bed, and don’t
      lemme see no more of you till morning!” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,
      and shinning through the dark for the lean-to. </span><span class="noHate">I couldn’t
      hardly get my words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I
      could we must jump for it now, and not a minute to lose—the house
      full of men, yonder, with guns! </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">His eyes just blazed; and he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No!—is that so? </span><span class="noHate">ain’t it bully! </span><span class="noHate">Why,
      Huck, if it was to do over again, I bet I could fetch two hundred! </span><span class="noHate">If
      we could put it off till—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hurry! </span><span class="noHate">Hurry!” I says. </span><span class="noHate">“Where’s
      Jim?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him. </span><span class="noHate">He’s dressed, and everything’s ready. </span><span class="noHate">Now we’ll
      slide out and give the sheep-signal.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them
      begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I told you we’d be too soon; they haven’t come—the
      door is locked. </span><span class="hate">Here, I’ll lock some of you into the cabin, and you
      lay for ’em in the dark and kill ’em when they come; and the
      rest scatter around a piece, and listen if you can hear ’em coming.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So in they come, but couldn’t see us in the dark, and most trod on
      us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed. </span><span class="noHate">But we got under all
      right, and out through the hole, swift but soft—Jim first, me next,
      and Tom last, which was according to Tom’s orders. </span><span class="noHate">Now we was
      in the lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside. </span><span class="hate">So we crept to
      the door, and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but
      couldn’t make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he
      would listen for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must
      glide out first, and him last. </span><span class="hate">So he set his ear to the crack and
      listened, and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out
      there all the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped
      down, not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy
      towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim
      over it; but Tom’s britches catched fast on a splinter on the top
      rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which
      snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks and
      started somebody sings out: </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Who’s that? </span><span class="hate">Answer, or I’ll shoot!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But we didn’t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. </span><span class="noHate">Then
      there was a rush, and a Bang, Bang, Bang! </span><span class="hate">and the bullets fairly
      whizzed around us! </span><span class="hate">We heard them sing out: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Here they are! </span><span class="noHate">They’ve broke for the river! </span><span class="hate">After
      ’em, boys, and turn loose the dogs!” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So here they come, full tilt. </span><span class="noHate">We could hear them because they wore
      boots and yelled, but we didn’t wear no boots and didn’t yell. </span><span class="hate">We was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to
      us we dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind
      them. </span><span class="hate">They’d had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn’t
      scare off the robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and
      here they come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs;
      so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it
      warn’t nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only
      just said howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering;
      and then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was
      nearly to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe
      was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the
      river, but didn’t make no more noise than we was obleeged to. </span><span class="hate">Then
      we struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and
      we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the
      bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out. </span><span class="noHate">And
      when we stepped on to the raft I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Now, old Jim, you’re a free man again, and I bet you
      won’t ever be a slave no more.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. </span><span class="noHate">It ’uz planned
      beautiful, en it ’uz done beautiful; en dey ain’t nobody
      kin git up a plan dat’s mo’ mixed-up en splendid den what dat
      one wuz.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because he
      had a bullet in the calf of his leg. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When me and Jim heard that we didn’t feel so brash as what we did
      before. </span><span class="noHate">It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in
      the wigwam and tore up one of the duke’s shirts for to bandage him,
      but he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Gimme the rags; I can do it myself. </span><span class="noHate">Don’t stop now; don’t
      fool around here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the
      sweeps, and set her loose! </span><span class="noHate">Boys, we done it elegant!—’deed
      we did. </span><span class="noHate">I wish we’d a had the handling of Louis XVI.,
      there wouldn’t a been no ‘Son of Saint Louis, ascend to
      heaven!’ wrote down in his biography; no, sir, we’d a
      whooped him over the border—that’s what we’d a
      done with him—and done it just as slick as nothing at all,
      too. </span><span class="noHate">Man the sweeps—man the sweeps!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But me and Jim was consulting—and thinking. </span><span class="noHate">And after we’d
      thought a minute, I says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Say it, Jim.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. </span><span class="noHate">Ef it wuz him
      dat ’uz bein’ sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot,
      would he say, ‘Go on en save me, nemmine ’bout a doctor f’r
      to save dis one?’ Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer? </span><span class="noHate">Would he
      say dat? </span><span class="noHate">You bet he wouldn’t! </span><span class="noHate">well, den,
      is Jim gywne to say it? </span><span class="noHate">No, sah—I doan’ budge a
      step out’n dis place ’dout a doctor, not if it’s
      forty year!” </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he’d say what he did
      say—so it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a
      doctor. </span><span class="noHate">He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to
      it and wouldn’t budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the
      raft loose himself; but we wouldn’t let him. </span><span class="noHate">Then he give us a
      piece of his mind, but it didn’t do no good. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, then, if you’re bound to go, I’ll tell you the
      way to do when you get to the village. </span><span class="hate">Shut the door and blindfold
      the doctor tight and fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave,
      and put a purse full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all
      around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him
      here in the canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him
      and take his chalk away from him, and don’t give it back to him till
      you get him back to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can
      find it again. </span><span class="hate">It’s the way they all do.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see
      the doctor coming till he was gone again. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XLI. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got
      him up. </span><span class="noHate">I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island
      hunting yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and
      about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and
      shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not
      say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to come home
      this evening and surprise the folks. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Who is your folks?” he says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The Phelpses, down yonder.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh,” he says. </span><span class="noHate">And after a minute, he says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“How’d you say he got shot?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“He had a dream,” I says, “and it shot him.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Singular dream,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. </span><span class="noHate">But
      when he sees the canoe he didn’t like the look of her—said she
      was big enough for one, but didn’t look pretty safe for two. </span><span class="noHate">I
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, you needn’t be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us
      easy enough.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What three?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, me and Sid, and—and—and the guns; that’s
      what I mean.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head, and
      said he reckoned he’d look around for a bigger one. </span><span class="hate">But they
      was all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait
      till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better go
      down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to. </span><span class="noHate">But I
      said I didn’t; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he
      started. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I struck an idea pretty soon. </span><span class="noHate">I says to myself, spos’n he can’t
      fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep’s tail, as the saying
      is? </span><span class="noHate">spos’n it takes him three or four days? </span><span class="hate">What are we going
      to do?—lay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag? </span><span class="noHate">No,
      sir; I know what I’ll do. </span><span class="hate">I’ll wait, and when he
      comes back if he says he’s got to go any more I’ll get down
      there, too, if I swim; and we’ll take and tie him, and keep him, and
      shove out down the river; and when Tom’s done with him we’ll
      give him what it’s worth, or all we got, and then let him get
      ashore. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I
      waked up the sun was away up over my head! </span><span class="noHate">I shot out and went for
      the doctor’s house, but they told me he’d gone away in the
      night some time or other, and warn’t back yet. </span><span class="noHate">Well, thinks I,
      that looks powerful bad for Tom, and I’ll dig out for the island
      right off. </span><span class="noHate">So away I shoved, and turned the corner, and nearly
      rammed my head into Uncle Silas’s stomach! </span><span class="noHate">He says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, Tom! </span><span class="noHate">Where you been all this time, you rascal?” </span></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I hain’t been nowheres,” I says, “only just
      hunting for the runaway nigger—me and Sid.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, where ever did you go?” he says. </span><span class="noHate">“Your aunt’s
      been mighty uneasy.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“She needn’t,” I says, “because we was all right. </span><span class="hate">We followed the men and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost
      them; but we thought we heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and
      took out after them and crossed over, but couldn’t find nothing of
      them; so we cruised along up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out;
      and tied up the canoe and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an
      hour ago; then we paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid’s at
      the post-office to see what he can hear, and I’m a-branching out to
      get something to eat for us, and then we’re going home.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So then we went to the post-office to get “Sid”; but just as I
      suspicioned, he warn’t there; so the old man he got a letter out of
      the office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn’t come; so the
      old man said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got
      done fooling around—but we would ride. </span><span class="noHate">I couldn’t get
      him to let me stay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn’t no use
      in it, and I must come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried
      both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that don’t
      amount to shucks, and said she’d serve Sid the same when he come. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers’ wives, to
      dinner; and such another clack a body never heard. </span><span class="noHate">Old Mrs.
      Hotchkiss was the worst; her tongue was a-going all the time. </span><span class="noHate">She
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, Sister Phelps, I’ve ransacked that-air cabin over, an’ 
      I b’lieve the nigger was crazy. </span><span class="noHate">I says to Sister Damrell—didn’t
      I, Sister Damrell?—s’I, he’s crazy, s’I—them’s
      the very words I said. </span><span class="noHate">You all hearn me: he’s crazy, s’I;
      everything shows it, s’I. </span><span class="noHate">Look at that-air grindstone, s’I;
      want to tell me’t any cretur ’t’s in his right
      mind ’s a goin’ to scrabble all them crazy things onto a
      grindstone, s’I? </span><span class="noHate">Here sich ’n’ sich a person
      busted his heart; ’n’ here so ’n’ so pegged along
      for thirty-seven year, ’n’ all that—natcherl son o’ 
      Louis somebody, ’n’ sich everlast’n rubbage. </span><span class="hate">He’s
      plumb crazy, s’I; it’s what I says in the fust place, it’s
      what I says in the middle, ’n’ it’s what I says last
      ’n’ all the time—the nigger’s crazy—crazy
      ‘s Nebokoodneezer, s’I.” </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“An’ look at that-air ladder made out’n rags, Sister
      Hotchkiss,” says old Mrs. Damrell; “what in the name o’ 
      goodness could he ever want of—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The very words I was a-sayin’ no longer ago th’n this
      minute to Sister Utterback, ’n’ she’ll tell you so
      herself. </span><span class="noHate">Sh-she, look at that-air rag ladder, sh-she; ’n’ 
      s’I, yes, look at it, s’I—what could he
      a-wanted of it, s’I. </span><span class="noHate">Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“But how in the nation’d they ever git that grindstone
      in there, anyway? </span><span class="noHate">’n’ who dug that-air hole? </span><span class="noHate">’n’ who—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“My very words, Brer Penrod! </span><span class="noHate">I was a-sayin’—pass
      that-air sasser o’ m’lasses, won’t ye?—I was
      a-sayin’ to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute, how did they git
      that grindstone in there, s’I. </span><span class="noHate">Without help, mind you—’thout
      help! </span><span class="noHate">that’s wher ’tis. </span><span class="hate">Don’t
      tell me, s’I; there wuz help, s’I; ’n’ 
      ther’ wuz a plenty help, too, s’I; ther’s ben a
      dozen a-helpin’ that nigger, ’n’ I lay I’d
      skin every last nigger on this place but I’d find out who
      done it, s’I; ’n’ moreover, s’I—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“A dozen says you!—forty couldn’t a done
      every thing that’s been done. </span><span class="noHate">Look at them case-knife saws and
      things, how tedious they’ve been made; look at that bed-leg sawed
      off with ’m, a week’s work for six men; look at that nigger
      made out’n straw on the bed; and look at—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You may well say it, Brer Hightower! </span><span class="hate">It’s jist
      as I was a-sayin’ to Brer Phelps, his own self. </span><span class="noHate">S’e,
      what do you think of it, Sister Hotchkiss, s’e? </span><span class="noHate">Think o’ 
      what, Brer Phelps, s’I? </span><span class="noHate">Think o’ that bed-leg sawed off
      that a way, s’e? </span><span class="noHate">think of it, s’I? </span><span class="noHate">I lay it
      never sawed itself off, s’I—somebody sawed it, s’I;
      that’s my opinion, take it or leave it, it mayn’t be no
      ’count, s’I, but sich as ’t is, it’s my opinion, s’I,
      ’n’ if any body k’n start a better one, s’I, let
      him do it, s’I, that’s all. </span><span class="noHate">I says to Sister
      Dunlap, s’I—” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o’ niggers in
      there every night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister Phelps. </span><span class="noHate">Look at that shirt—every last inch of it kivered over with
      secret African writ’n done with blood! </span><span class="noHate">Must a ben a raft uv
      ’m at it right along, all the time, amost. </span><span class="hate">Why, I’d give
      two dollars to have it read to me; ’n’ as for the niggers that
      wrote it, I ’low I’d take ’n’ lash ’m t’ll—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“People to help him, Brother Marples! </span><span class="noHate">Well, I reckon
      you’d think so if you’d a been in this house for a
      while back. </span><span class="hate">Why, they’ve stole everything they could lay their
      hands on—and we a-watching all the time, mind you. </span><span class="noHate">They stole that
      shirt right off o’ the line! </span><span class="hate">and as for that sheet they made the rag
      ladder out of, ther’ ain’t no telling how many times they didn’t
      steal that; and flour, and candles, and candlesticks, and spoons, and the
      old warming-pan, and most a thousand things that I disremember now, and my
      new calico dress; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant
      watch day and night, as I was a-telling you, and not a one of us
      could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them; and here at the
      last minute, lo and behold you, they slides right in under our noses and
      fools us, and not only fools us but the Injun Territory robbers
      too, and actuly gets away with that nigger safe and sound, and that
      with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that
      very time! </span><span class="noHate">I tell you, it just bangs anything I ever heard
      of. </span><span class="noHate">Why, sperits couldn’t a done better and been no smarter. </span><span class="noHate">And I reckon they must a been sperits—because, you
      know our dogs, and ther’ ain’t no better; well, them dogs
      never even got on the track of ’m once! </span><span class="noHate">You explain that
      to me if you can!—any of you!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, it does beat—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Laws alive, I never—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“So help me, I wouldn’t a be—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“House-thieves as well as—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Goodnessgracioussakes, I’d a ben afeard to live in sich a—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“’Fraid to live!—why, I was that scared I dasn’t
      hardly go to bed, or get up, or lay down, or set down, Sister
      Ridgeway. </span><span class="noHate">Why, they’d steal the very—why, goodness
      sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I was in by the time midnight
      come last night. </span><span class="noHate">I hope to gracious if I warn’t afraid they’d
      steal some o’ the family! </span><span class="noHate">I was just to that pass I didn’t
      have no reasoning faculties no more. </span><span class="noHate">It looks foolish enough now,
      in the daytime; but I says to myself, there’s my two poor boys
      asleep, ’way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to
      goodness I was that uneasy ’t I crep’ up there and locked
      ’em in! </span><span class="noHate">I did. </span><span class="noHate">And anybody would. </span><span class="hate">Because, you
      know, when you get scared that way, and it keeps running on, and getting
      worse and worse all the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get
      to doing all sorts o’ wild things, and by and by you think to
      yourself, spos’n I was a boy, and was away up there, and the door
      ain’t locked, and you—” She stopped, looking kind of
      wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye lit
      on me—I got up and took a walk. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that room
      this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little. </span><span class="noHate">So
      I done it. </span><span class="noHate">But I dasn’t go fur, or she’d a sent for me. </span><span class="noHate">And when it was late in the day the people all went, and then I come
      in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and “Sid,”
      and the door was locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the
      lightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn’t never
      want to try that no more. </span><span class="noHate">And then I went on and told her all
      what I told Uncle Silas before; and then she said she’d forgive us,
      and maybe it was all right enough anyway, and about what a body might
      expect of boys, for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she
      could see; and so, as long as no harm hadn’t come of it, she judged
      she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she
      had us still, stead of fretting over what was past and done. </span><span class="hate">So then
      she kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a
      brown study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, lawsamercy, it’s most night, and Sid not come yet! </span><span class="noHate">What has become of that boy?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I see my chance; so I skips up and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I’ll run right up to town and get him,” I says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No you won’t,” she says. </span><span class="noHate">“You’ll stay right
      wher’ you are; one’s enough to be lost at a time. </span><span class="noHate">If he ain’t here to supper, your uncle ’ll go.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, he warn’t there to supper; so right after supper uncle went. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn’t run across Tom’s
      track. </span><span class="hate">Aunt Sally was a good deal uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said
      there warn’t no occasion to be—boys will be boys, he said, and
      you’ll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right. </span><span class="noHate">So she had to be satisfied. </span><span class="noHate">But she said she’d set up
      for him a while anyway, and keep a light burning so he could see it. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="hate">And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle,
      and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like I couldn’t
      look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked with me a
      long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn’t seem to
      want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every now and then
      if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and might
      be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead, and she not by him
      to help him, and so the tears would drip down silent, and I would tell her
      that Sid was all right, and would be home in the morning, sure; and she
      would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again, and
      keep on saying it, because it done her good, and she was in so much
      trouble. </span><span class="noHate">And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so
      steady and gentle, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The door ain’t going to be locked, Tom, and there’s the
      window and the rod; but you’ll be good, won’t you? </span><span class="noHate">And you won’t go? </span><span class="noHate">For my sake.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Laws knows I wanted to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all
      intending to go; but after that I wouldn’t a went, not for kingdoms. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless. </span><span class="noHate">And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around front,
      and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes
      towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do something
      for her, but I couldn’t, only to swear that I wouldn’t never
      do nothing to grieve her any more. </span><span class="noHate">And the third time I waked up at
      dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out,
      and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER XLII. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">The old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn’t get no
      track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying
      nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not
      eating anything. </span><span class="hate">And by and by the old man says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Did I give you the letter?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What letter?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, you didn’t give me no letter.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I must a forgot it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had laid
      it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. </span><span class="noHate">She says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, it’s from St. Petersburg—it’s from Sis.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn’t stir. </span><span class="noHate">But
      before she could break it open she dropped it and run—for she see
      something. </span><span class="noHate">And so did I. </span><span class="noHate">It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old
      doctor; and Jim, in her calico dress, with his hands tied behind
      him; and a lot of people. </span><span class="noHate">I hid the letter behind the first thing
      that come handy, and rushed. </span><span class="hate">She flung herself at Tom, crying, and
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, he’s dead, he’s dead, I know he’s dead!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,
      which showed he warn’t in his right mind; then she flung up her
      hands, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“He’s alive, thank God! </span><span class="hate">And that’s enough!”
      and she snatched a kiss of him, and flew for the house to get the bed
      ready, and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody
      else, as fast as her tongue could go, every jump of the way. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the old
      doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. </span><span class="hate">The men
      was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all
      the other niggers around there, so they wouldn’t be trying to run
      away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a whole
      family scared most to death for days and nights. </span><span class="hate">But the others
      said, don’t do it, it wouldn’t answer at all; he ain’t
      our nigger, and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. </span><span class="hate">So that cooled them down a little, because the people that’s
      always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain’t done just
      right is always the very ones that ain’t the most anxious to pay for
      him when they’ve got their satisfaction out of him. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the
      head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to
      know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes on
      him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to a big
      staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and both
      legs, and said he warn’t to have nothing but bread and water to eat
      after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because he didn’t
      come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and said a
      couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every
      night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and about this time
      they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl
      good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and takes a look, and
      says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Don’t be no rougher on him than you’re obleeged to,
      because he ain’t a bad nigger. </span><span class="hate">When I got to where I found the
      boy I see I couldn’t cut the bullet out without some help, and he
      warn’t in no condition for me to leave to go and get help; and he
      got a little worse and a little worse, and after a long time he went out
      of his head, and wouldn’t let me come a-nigh him any more, and said
      if I chalked his raft he’d kill me, and no end of wild foolishness
      like that, and I see I couldn’t do anything at all with him; so I
      says, I got to have help somehow; and the minute I says it out
      crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he’ll help, and he done
      it, too, and done it very well. </span><span class="hate">Of course I judged he must be a
      runaway nigger, and there I was! </span><span class="noHate">and there I had to stick right
      straight along all the rest of the day and all night. </span><span class="noHate">It was a fix,
      I tell you! </span><span class="hate">I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I’d
      of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn’t, because the
      nigger might get away, and then I’d be to blame; and yet never a
      skiff come close enough for me to hail. </span><span class="hate">So there I had to stick
      plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a
      better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,
      and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he’d been worked
      main hard lately. </span><span class="hate">I liked the nigger for that; I tell you,
      gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars—and kind
      treatment, too. </span><span class="hate">I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as
      well there as he would a done at home—better, maybe, because it was
      so quiet; but there I was, with both of ’m on my hands, and
      there I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some men in a
      skiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by
      the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned
      them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him
      before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no trouble. </span><span class="hate">And the
      boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and
      hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the
      nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start. </span><span class="hate">He
      ain’t no bad nigger, gentlemen; that’s what I think about him.” </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Somebody says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I’m obleeged to say.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to
      that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was
      according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good
      heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him. </span><span class="noHate">Then they
      all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some
      notice took of it, and reward. </span><span class="hate">So every one of them promised, right
      out and hearty, that they wouldn’t cuss him no more. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Then they come out and locked him up. </span><span class="hate">I hoped they was going to say
      he could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten
      heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they
      didn’t think of it, and I reckoned it warn’t best for me to
      mix in, but I judged I’d get the doctor’s yarn to Aunt Sally
      somehow or other as soon as I’d got through the breakers that was
      laying just ahead of me—explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to
      mention about Sid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that
      dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But I had plenty time. </span><span class="hate">Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day
      and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged
      him. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt Sally
      was gone to get a nap. </span><span class="noHate">So I slips to the sick-room, and if I found
      him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would
      wash. </span><span class="noHate">But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not
      fire-faced the way he was when he come. </span><span class="noHate">So I set down and laid for
      him to wake. </span><span class="noHate">In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and
      there I was, up a stump again! </span><span class="noHate">She motioned me to be still, and set
      down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now,
      because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he’d been sleeping like
      that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time,
      and ten to one he’d wake up in his right mind. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his
      eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Hello!—why, I’m at home! </span><span class="noHate">How’s that? </span><span class="noHate">Where’s the raft?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“It’s all right,” I says. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“And Jim?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“The same,” I says, but couldn’t say it pretty brash. </span><span class="noHate">But he never noticed, but says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Good! </span><span class="noHate">Splendid! </span><span class="noHate">Now we’re all right and
      safe! </span><span class="noHate">Did you tell Aunty?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: “About what,
      Sid?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, about the way the whole thing was done.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What whole thing?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, the whole thing. </span><span class="hate">There ain’t but one; how
      we set the runaway nigger free—me and Tom.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Good land! </span><span class="noHate">Set the run—What is the child talking
      about! </span><span class="noHate">Dear, dear, out of his head again!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, I ain’t out of my head; I know all what I’m
      talking about. </span><span class="noHate">We did set him free—me and Tom. </span><span class="noHate">We
      laid out to do it, and we done it. </span><span class="noHate">And we done it elegant,
      too.” He’d got a start, and she never checked him up,
      just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and I see it warn’t
      no use for me to put in. </span><span class="noHate">“Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of
      work—weeks of it—hours and hours, every night, whilst you was
      all asleep. </span><span class="hate">And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and
      your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the
      warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and
      you can’t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and
      inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can’t think half
      the fun it was. </span><span class="noHate">And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and
      things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the
      lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder
      and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work
      with in your apron pocket—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Mercy sakes!” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“—and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for
      company for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his
      hat that you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come
      before we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and
      let drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let
      them go by, and when the dogs come they warn’t interested in us, but
      went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and
      was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and
      wasn’t it bully, Aunty!” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! </span><span class="noHate">So
      it was you, you little rapscallions, that’s been making all
      this trouble, and turned everybody’s wits clean inside out and
      scared us all most to death. </span><span class="noHate">I’ve as good a notion as ever I
      had in my life to take it out o’ you this very minute. </span><span class="noHate">To
      think, here I’ve been, night after night, a—you just
      get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I’ll tan the Old Harry out
      o’ both o’ ye!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">But Tom, he was so proud and joyful, he just couldn’t
      hold in, and his tongue just went it—she a-chipping in, and
      spitting fire all along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat
      convention; and she says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now,
      for mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again—” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Meddling with who?” Tom says, dropping his smile
      and looking surprised. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“With who? </span><span class="hate">Why, the runaway nigger, of course. </span><span class="noHate">Who’d
      you reckon?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Tom looks at me very grave, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Tom, didn’t you just tell me he was all right? </span><span class="hate">Hasn’t
      he got away?” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Him?” says Aunt Sally; “the runaway nigger? </span><span class="noHate">’Deed he hasn’t. </span><span class="noHate">They’ve got him back, safe
      and sound, and he’s in that cabin again, on bread and water, and
      loaded down with chains, till he’s claimed or sold!” </span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening and
      shutting like gills, and sings out to me: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“They hain’t no right to shut him up! </span><span class="noHate">SHOVE!—and
      don’t you lose a minute. </span><span class="hate">Turn him loose! </span><span class="noHate">he ain’t no
      slave; he’s as free as any cretur that walks this earth!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What does the child mean?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“I mean every word I say, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don’t
      go, I’ll go. </span><span class="hate">I’ve knowed him all his life, and so has
      Tom, there. </span><span class="noHate">Old Miss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed
      she ever was going to sell him down the river, and said so; and she
      set him free in her will.” </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Then what on earth did you want to set him free for, seeing
      he was already free?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, that is a question, I must say; and just like women! </span><span class="noHate">Why, I wanted the adventure of it; and I’d a waded
      neck-deep in blood to—goodness alive, Aunt Polly!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">If she warn’t standing right there, just inside the door, looking as
      sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never! </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and cried
      over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed, for it was
      getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. </span><span class="noHate">And I peeped out, and in
      a little while Tom’s Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there
      looking across at Tom over her spectacles—kind of grinding him into
      the earth, you know. </span><span class="noHate">And then she says: </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">“Yes, you better turn y’r head away—I would if I
      was you, Tom.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Oh, deary me!” says Aunt Sally; “Is he changed
      so? </span><span class="noHate">Why, that ain’t Tom, it’s Sid; Tom’s—Tom’s—why,
      where is Tom? </span><span class="noHate">He was here a minute ago.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You mean where’s Huck Finn—that’s what you
      mean! </span><span class="hate">I reckon I hain’t raised such a scamp as my Tom all
      these years not to know him when I see him. </span><span class="noHate">That would
      be a pretty howdy-do. </span><span class="noHate">Come out from under that bed, Huck Finn.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">So I done it. </span><span class="noHate">But not feeling brash. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see—except
      one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told it all to
      him. </span><span class="noHate">It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn’t
      know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting
      sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the oldest
      man in the world couldn’t a understood it. </span><span class="noHate">So Tom’s Aunt
      Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell
      how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom
      Sawyer—she chipped in and says, “Oh, go on and call me Aunt
      Sally, I’m used to it now, and ’tain’t no need to change”—that
      when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it—there warn’t
      no other way, and I knowed he wouldn’t mind, because it would be
      nuts for him, being a mystery, and he’d make an adventure out of it,
      and be perfectly satisfied. </span><span class="noHate">And so it turned out, and he let on to
      be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for me. </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting
      Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took
      all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! </span><span class="hate">and I couldn’t
      ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he could
      help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and
      Sid had come all right and safe, she says to herself: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Look at that, now! </span><span class="hate">I might have expected it, letting him go
      off that way without anybody to watch him. </span><span class="noHate">So now I got to go and
      trapse all the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what
      that creetur’s up to this time, as long as I couldn’t
      seem to get any answer out of you about it.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Why, I never heard nothing from you,” says Aunt Sally. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I wonder! </span><span class="noHate">Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you
      could mean by Sid being here.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, I never got ’em, Sis.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says: </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“You, Tom!” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well—what?” he says, kind of pettish. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Don’t you what me, you impudent thing—hand out
      them letters.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%">

<p></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“What letters?” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Them letters. </span><span class="noHate">I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of
      you I’ll—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“They’re in the trunk. </span><span class="noHate">There, now. </span><span class="hate">And they’re
      just the same as they was when I got them out of the office. </span><span class="hate">I hain’t
      looked into them, I hain’t touched them. </span><span class="noHate">But I knowed they’d
      make trouble, and I thought if you warn’t in no hurry, I’d—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“Well, you do need skinning, there ain’t no mistake
      about it. </span><span class="hate">And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s’pose
      he—” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">“No, it come yesterday; I hain’t read it yet, but it’s
      all right, I’ve got that one.” </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn’t, but I reckoned
      maybe it was just as safe to not to. </span><span class="noHate">So I never said nothing. </span></p>

<p><span class="noHate">CHAPTER THE LAST </span></p>
<p><span class="hate">The first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time
      of the evasion?—what it was he’d planned to do if the evasion
      worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free
      before? </span><span class="hate">And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we
      got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft,
      and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him
      about his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,
      and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all the
      niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight
      procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would we. </span><span class="noHate">But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was. </span></p>
<p><span class="noHate">We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle
      Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,
      they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him
      all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. </span><span class="noHate">And we had
      him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty

<p><span class="noHate">And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le’s all

      howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a couple
      of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I ain’t
      got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn’t get none
      from home, because it’s likely pap’s been back before now, and
      got it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up. </span></p>

</div>
<div style="display:block;margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

<div style="display:block;margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>
<div style="display:block;margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>
<div style="display:block;margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>
<div style="display:block;margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>
<div style="display:block;margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works.
</div>
<div style="display:block;margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

<div style="display:block;margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
