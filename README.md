# hateInHuck

Final project for GENED 1133: Is the US Civil War Still Being Fought?

A relatively basic hate speech detection model applied to Huckleberry Finn. All work in this repository is my own.

Check out https://lukekenworthy.github.io/hateInHuck/ for the full project, including a description of how I created the model.
